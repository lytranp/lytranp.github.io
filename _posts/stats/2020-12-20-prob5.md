### Probability model

Sometimes, it is necessary to move away from individual probability scenarios, and start to see situations in which probabilities follow a certain predictable pattern that you can use a probability model to describe.

A probability model gives you formulas to calculate probabilities, determine long-term average outcomes and amount of variability you can expect in the results from 1 random experiment to the next. 

A probability model is a mathematical model you use to fit a random process. Each random process must meet a different set of assumptions for each different model.

The main parts of a probability model: random variable and its probability distribution

**a. Random variable**

E.g: Roll 2 dice: there are 36 potential outcomes: {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)....(6,4),(6,5),(6,6)}. Random variable X represents the sum of the potential outcomes. 

+ Discrete random variable

    + Finite number of possible values (E.g: total heads when flip coin 1,000 times)

    + Countably infinite number of possible values (E.g: the number of car accidents because you can not know an upper limit for this value.)

+ Continuous random variable

**b. Probability distribution**

+ Probability mass function (pmf) for a discrete random variable because it shows how much probability is given to each value of random variables. Discrete random variables have cumulative distribution function that take a fixed value for a certain interval, and then jump up at the next value.

+ Probability density function (pdf) for continuous random variable because it does not actually assign probability, it assigns density, which means you find probabilities for intervals of X, not particular values of X when X is continuous. In another word, continuous random variables have no probability at any single point. Continuous random variables have cumulative distribution function that is continuous.

## Part A - Probability basics in terms of discrete random variables

### 1. Probability mass distribution (pmf)

![](/sources/prob5-1.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

We can draw a picture of the probability distribution of discrete random variable X by using relative frequency histogram.

![](/sources/prob5-2.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

![](/sources/prob5-3.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

After set up a probability distribution, we can use it for calculating various probabilities. 

**Example**

P(at least 7) = P(7 <= X <= 12) = P(X=7) + P(X=8) + P(X=9) + P(X=10) + P(X=11) + P(12) = 6/36 + 5/36 + 4/36 + 3/36 + 2/36 + 1/36

P(less than 7) = P(X=2) + ...+P(X=6)

P(at most 10) = P(2 <= X <= 10) = 1 - (P(X=11) + P(X=12))

### 2. Cumulative distribution function (cdf)

![](/sources/prob5-4.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

![](/sources/prob5-5.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

We can draw cumulative distribution function as the below

![](/sources/prob5-6.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

After set up cdf, we can use it for calculating various probabilities. 

**Example**

P(5 < X < 8) = take all the probability of X from 2 through X < 8 substract all the probability of X from 2 through X < 5 = 21/36 - 10/36

### 3. Determine pmf given cdf

Given cdf F(x), you can find the probability mass function (pmf) for X

![](/sources/prob5-7.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

At X = 0, cdf jumps from 0 to 0.3 => P(X = 0) = 0.3. Next jump occurs when X = 1 and cdf jumps from 0.3 to 0.65

=> P(X = 1) = 0.65 - 0.3 = 0.35

Next jump occurs at X = 2 where cdf jumps from 0.65 to 0.8

=> P(X = 2) = 0.8 - 0.65 = 0.15

### 4. Expected Value, Variance of a Discrete Random Variable

**a. Expected value**: is the long-term average value after repeating an experiment theoretically infinite number of times. 

Expected value formula of a discrete random variable

![](/sources/prob5-16.png){:height="15%" width="15%"}

To find expected value E(x): multiply the value of X by its probability. Repeat this step for all possible values of X. Then, sum the results.

Example:

![](/sources/prob5-8.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

E(X) = 0 * 0.3 + 1 * 0.35 + 2 * 0.15 + 3 * 0.1 + 4 * 0.05 + 5 * 0.03 + 6 * 0.02 = 1.42

=> Because more weight around 1 or 2, E(X) is approximately in around [1,2]. Over the long term, this salesperson should expect to sell 1.42 refrigerators per day on average, based on the data collected. In another word, over hundreds of days selling, you will come closer to the truth 1.42. That is why probability formulas are so helpful. 

**b. Variance**

![](/sources/prob5-9.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

Shortcut formula: Variance = $E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2$

$[E(X)]^2 = 1.42^2$

$E(X^2) = 0^2 * 0.3 + 1^2 * 0.35 + 2^2 * 0.15 + 3^2 * 0.1 + 4^2 * 0.05 + 5^2 * 0.03 + 6^2 * 0.02 = 4.12$ 

=> Variance = 4.12 - 2.02 = 2.10

### 5. Basic probability models of discrete distribution

There are many types of probability models for discrete random variables. Each type of model has its own name, its own formulas for pmf and cdf, and its own formulas for the expected value, variance. 

+ Discrete uniform distribution

+ Binomial distribution

+ Poisson distribution

**a. Discrete uniform distribution**

A random variable X has a discrete uniform distribution if: possible values of X are consecutive integers from a to b; and possible value of X has an equal probability.

***The pmf of the discrete uniform - Find probability for uniform***

![](/sources/prob5-10.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

The graph of the pmf of a uniform random variable is flat because each possible values of X has equal probability

Suppose a = 0; b = 9 => b - a + 1 = 10 possible values of X, and each one gets probability 1/10 = 0.1

Example: Roll a single die. Possible values of X = {1,2,3,4,5,6}: are consecutive integers => fits a discrete uniform probability model. Because each possible value of X has equal probability, pmf of X = 1/(6-1+1) = 0.17

Note: sum of 2 dice rolled does not have a uniform distribution although sum of 2 dice are consecutive but each possible value of X does not have equal probability.

***The cdf of the discrete uniform***

![](/sources/prob5-11.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

Example: Roll a single dice => a = 1; b = 6. So, cumulative distribution function F(2) = (2-1+1) / (6-1+1) = 1/3. Verify: P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

***The expected value, variance of the discrete uniform***

Expected value E(X) = $\frac{b + a}{2}$

Variance = $\frac{(b - a + 2)(b-a)}{12}$

**b. Binomial distribution**

Suppose you flip a fair coin 10 times and count the number of heads.

To have a binomial distribution, a random variable X must meet the following conditions

+ Have a fixed number of trials (In this example, n = 10)

+ You can classify outcome of each trial into 2 groups: success or failure (Head or Tail)

+ P(success) is the same for each trial (because you flip coin the same way each time => p = 1/2)

+ The trials are independent (the outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of subsequent flips)

=> Coin-flipping experiment meets 4 above conditions, random variable X which counts the number of success that occur in 10 trials, has a binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 1/2

***The pmf of binomial distribution - Find probability for binomial***

![](/sources/prob5-12.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

Example: Flip a coin 3 times. P(exactly 2 heads) ? 

$\binom{n}{x}$ means the number of ways to get x successes from n trials.

$\binom{n}{x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$

Because X is the number of heads and in this case, you want the P(X = 2)

We have: n = 3; X = 2; p = 1/2 and $\binom{3}{2} = 3$. 

Plug into the formula: $3 * (\frac{1}{2})^{2} * (1-\frac{1}{2})^\frac{3}{2} = 0.375$

***The cdf of binomial distribution - Binomial distribution table***

If you have to solve problems with more than 2 values of X, e.g, P(X < 6) when n = 10 and p = 1/2. It means that we have to solve pmf for each X = 1,2,3,4,5,6, then sum up all. This takes a long time and many calculations. So, experts placed the cdf for the binomial into table form where the probabilities are summed up in each case. 

![](/sources/prob5-15.png){:height="60%" width="60%"}

Example 1: Using this table for the above: n = 3; X = 2; p = 0.5 => P(exactly 2 heads) = 0.375

Example 2: Peter shoots exactly 60% of his attempts. If he has 6 attempts, P(make exactly 4) ? 

=> n = 6; p = 0.6; X = 4 

=> P(make exactly 4) = 0.311

***The expected value, variance of the binomial***

Expected value: From general formula of Expected value for discrete random variable, P(x) is replaced by P(X) using pmf of the binomial.
