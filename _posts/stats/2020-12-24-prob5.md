### Probability model

Sometimes, it is necessary to move away from individual probability scenarios, and start to see situations in which probabilities follow a certain predictable pattern that you can use a probability model to describe.

A probability model gives you formulas to calculate probabilities, determine long-term average outcomes and amount of variability you can expect in the results from 1 random experiment to the next. 

A probability model is a mathematical model you use to fit a random process. Each random process must meet a different set of assumptions for each different model.

The main parts of a probability model: random variable and its probability distribution

**a. Random variable**

E.g: Roll 2 dice: there are 36 potential outcomes: {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)....(6,4),(6,5),(6,6)}. Random variable X represents the sum of the potential outcomes. 

+ Discrete random variable

    + Finite number of possible values (E.g: total heads when flip coin 1,000 times)

    + Countably infinite number of possible values (E.g: the number of car accidents because you can not know an upper limit for this value.)

+ Continuous random variable

**b. Probability distribution**

+ Probability mass function (pmf) for a discrete random variable because it shows how much probability is given to each value of random variables. Discrete random variables have cumulative distribution function that take a fixed value for a certain interval, and then jump up at the next value.

+ Probability density function (pdf) for continuous random variable because it does not actually assign probability, it assigns density, which means you find probabilities for intervals of X, not particular values of X when X is continuous. In another word, continuous random variables have no probability at any single point. Continuous random variables have cumulative distribution function that is continuous.
