## Part B - Probability basics in terms of continuous random variables (continued)

There are many different distributions for continuous random variables. For each distribution, we have the range, the p.d.f, the c.d.f and situations that it models. Each probability distribution has parameters (most distributions have between 1-3 parameters). These distributions all depend on parameters because the parameters establishes the shape of distribution and essential properties of the distribution, such as the central tendency and the variability.

+ Exponential distribution

+ Normal distribution

+ t-distribution

+ Chi-square distribution

+ F-distribution

### 3. Normal distribution (Gaussian distribution)

The two parameters entirely define the shape and all other properties of the normal distribution

When $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = 1$, the curve is called **standardized normal distributon**. All possible normal distributions of x may be normalized.

**a. Probability of normal distribution**

To calculate the probability that variable falls within a given interval, we have to calculate the following defnnite integral.

Although the graph is nice, formula p.d.f is complicated. So, to find probability of continuous random variable over an interval under any normal distribution, we use Z-table based on standard normal distribution (has mean 0 and variance 1). All we need is one formula to transform normal distribution (X) to the standard normal (Z) distribution, then use Z table to find the probability. 

Z-table is a table that shows the values of c.d.f of standard normal (Z) distribution for any value of z. Cdf is the cumulative distribution function and it gives you the area under the curve from negative infinity up to z for any value on the Z distribution.

*Example 1*: In a given population of adult men, the mean weight is 70 kg, with a standard deviation of 3 kg. 

*What is the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population would have a weight <= 65kg ?*

To normalize distribution, we need to calculate the value of z

Then, we should calculate the area under curve

Because formula is complicated to compute, we use Z-table to see value of our interval that has been already calculated and tabulated.

*What is the probability that a randomly selected individual from this population would have a weight between 65kg and 74 Kg?*

*Example 2*: You enter a fishing contest. The contests takes a place in a pond where the fish have lengths modeled by a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ = 16 inches and $\sigma = 4$ inches. Probability for you to catch a fish between 18 and 24 inches ?

+ Convert 2 values X into Z values: Z = $\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

+ Using z-table to look up. 

*Example 3*: Scores on college entrance exam are normally distributed with mean $\mu$ = 82 and $\sigma = 8$. Approximately what percentage of students score less than 84 on the exam ?

+ Convert value X int Z score = (84 - 82) / 8 = 0.25

+ Using z-table: 59.87% of students score less than 84 on this exam

### 4. Note: Use a normal distribution to approximate binomial probabilities

As part A mentioned, the binomial model has a unique set of formulas for individual and cumulative probabilities. But if the number of fixed trials, n, get too large like the below example, it is time consuming to calculate.

Researchers found that you can use normal distribution to get approximate answers to binomial probability problems when n is large.
