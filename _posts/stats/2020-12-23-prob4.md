Counting rules provide a mathematical way to count the number of ways that a certain outcome can occur.

### 1. Counting on Permutations

Permutation: count the number of ways that k items chosen from n items without replacement and the order is important.

+ n: total number of items in the population

+ k: the number of items being selected

+ Because you select k items only, remaining items should not be concern. So, you will leave out (n - k) items unselected.

+ The number of ways to rearrange k items gets very large and very quickly as the number of objects increases. E.g. 24 ways to rearrange 4 people out of 6, but if k increases to 5 people, the number of ways increases to 120. 

+ **Note**: When the order matters, use permutation. How do you know if the order matters? Think about what happens after the items are selected and whether the order they appear in matters. E.g, if choosing 3 people from a class to win a prize, the prizes are the same and the order does not matter. But if choosing 3 people to win 3 different prizes, the order does matter.

***Example 1***: Take picture of 3 boys: A, B, C. How many ways to arrange boys ?

A   B   C

A   C   B

B   A   C

B   C   A

C   A   B

C   B   A

3 choices for A; 2 choices left B (after A had its own choice); and 1 choice left for C (after A, B had their own choices). So, total number of permutations = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

If applying the formula, you have number of permutations of 3 boys chosen from 3 boys.

P $\binom{3}{3}$ = $\frac{3!}{(3 - 3)!} = 3!$

***Example 2*** How many ways to choose 4 people from the group of 6 ? 

Because you only select 4, you will take other two people out of the equation. 

P $\binom{6}{4}$ = $\frac{6!}{(6 - 4)!}$


**a. Permutation problems with added restrictions**

How many ways you can rearrange 4 individuals: Jim, Arun, Soma and Eric in a row so that Soma and Eric do not sit next to each other? 

=> Find total ways that Soma and Eric sit next to each other, then subtract from the total

![](/sources/prob4-2.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

After Eric selects his seat, Soma automatically sits on his right => 3 ways for Eric and Soma sitting next to each other in the case Soma sits on his right. If Soma sits on his left, we also have another 3 ways.

=> There are 6 ways for Soma and Eric sitting next to each other. And there is P $\binom{4}{4}$ = 24 ways 

=> There are: 24 - 6 = 18 ways of rearranging 4 people but Soma and Eric do not sit next to each other

**b. Permutation problems when certain items are the same and others are distinct**

How many ways you can rearrange letters of word "MISSISSIPI" ?

=> The word contains 11 letters, but not all the letters are distinct: 4S, 2P, and 4I. So, changing order of alike letters does not affect the word => the order does not matter when the letters are the same. 

=> We need to leave out the number of rearrangement of the like letters.

+ 4S => 4! ways of rearranging S

+ 2P => 2! ways of rearranging P

+ 4I => 4! ways of rearranging I

=> Leave out total: 4! * 2! * 4! = 48

There is 11! ways of rearranging 11 letters in total 11 ones. Actually, because we do not count like letters, we have 11! / 49 = 34,650 possible distinguisable rearrangements of the letters in the word MISSISSIPI.

**c. Probability involving permutations**

Out of 26 letters, you choose 4 different letters. What is the chance that a person types out the word "sing" ? 

+ Find number of permutations for the event: To achieve the outcome "sing", there is only one ways to do so => P("sing") = 1. 

+ Find total number of ways to arrange all the items: P$\binom{26}{4}$ = number of ways to choose 4 letters from the 26 alphabet = 358,800 ways. Because you are arranging letters into "word", the order is important, so permutations works.

=> P("sing") = 1 / 358,800. 

### 2. Counting on Combinations

Select k items without replacement from a group of items n; but the order of selected items is not important. 

![](/sources/prob4-3.png){:height="10%" width="10%"}

+ You leave out (n-k) items you do not select (n-k)! and number of ways to arrange k items you do select (k!)

+ There are k! times more permutations than combinations when you choose k items from n items without replacement.

***Example 1***: there are 10 students in a class. Choose 3 students to win a prize.

If all the prizes are different: 10! / (10-3)! = 720 ways to rearrange and select 3 people from the class of 10. 

But because prizes here are the same, the order in which you choose 3 people is not important, you have divide 720 by 3! = 120 ways.

***Example 2***: A group of 10 friends going to a movie and need to split individuals into 2 groups: 1 group sits in the front row and another group sit in the back row. How many ways can you split groups ?

After choosing 5 people to sit in front row, you automatically assign the remaining 5 people to the back row. So, we only need to find ways to assign 5 people (the order of selected people does not matter) = C$\binom{10}{5}$ 

**Probability involving combinations**

***Example***: 10 people in a class: six males and four females and you want to choose a committee of 4 people. What's the chance of choosing a committee that contains:

*Exactly one male ?*

+ Find denominator of the probability = ways of choosing a committee of 4 people from 10 people = C$\binom{10}{4}$ = 210 ways

+ Find numerator: choose exactly 1 Male means that 1 male and 3 females. First, you choose 1 male from 6 males = C$\binom{6}{1}$ = 6 ways. At the same time, we have to make sure that 3 other people in the committee is females = choose 3 females from 4 females = C$\binom{4}{3}$ = 4 ways. Because we need exactly 1 male and 3 females, applying multiplication rule = 6 * 4 = 24 ways. 

=> P(Exactly one male) = 24/ 210 = 11%

*At least one male ?*

+ 1st way: using multiplication rule and addition rule. To choose a committee with at least one male, we have 4 possibilities: 1M-3F; 2M-2F; 3M-1F; 4M. Like above example, find P for each situation, then add them together. 

+ 2nd way: using complement rule. The opposite of "At least 1 male" means "no males". To choose no males, we need to choose 4 females C$\binom{4}{4}$ = 1 way and 0 males C$\binom{6}{0}$ = 1 way => There is 1 way to choose 4 females and 0 male. 

=> P(at least one male) = 1 - (1 / 210) = 0.995
