## Part B - Probability basics in terms of continuous random variables

The probability function of continuous distribution takes the form of a continuous curve called **normal distribution**, and its random variables takes on uncountably infinite number of possible values, meaning that the set of possible values is written as an interval. 

+ You can not use pmf for X. Rather, you use probability density function (pdf) for X. 
  
+ You can find P(X) on any interval of values of X. Probability over an interval represent the area under the curve that is the graph of f(x). 
  
+ Probability at a particular value X is 0 because there is uncountably infinite possible values of X.

Each "normal distribution" in the family of normal distribution has a similar shape, but little different depends on center and spread.

### 1. Probability density function f(x) for the normal distribution

Pdf is a continuous function whose formula gives graphs of "normal distribution" as above. To find P(continuous random variable), you find the area under the curve between 2 points you want the probability for.

### 2. Cdf for the normal distribution

Although the graph is nice, formula pdf is complicated. So, to find probability for any normal distribution, you use Z-table based on one particular normal distribution: called standard normal distribution. All you need is one formula to transform normal distribution (X) to the standard normal (Z) distribution, then use Z table to find the probability. 

Z-table is a table that shows the values of cdf of standard normal (Z) distribution for any value of z. Cdf is the cumulative distribution function and it gives you the area under the curve from negative infinity up to z for any value on the Z distribution.

### 3. Find probability of continuous variable using Z-table

*Example 1*: You enter a fishing contest. The contests takes a place in a pond where the fish have lengths modeled by a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ = 16 inches and $\sigma = 4$ inches. Probability for you to catch a fish between 18 and 24 inches ?

+ Convert 2 values X into Z values: Z = $\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

+ Using z-table to look up. 

*Example 2*: Scores on college entrance exam are normally distributed with mean $\mu$ = 82 and $\sigma = 8$. Approximately what percentage of students score less than 84 on the exam ?

+ Convert value X int Z score = (84 - 82) / 8 = 0.25

+ Using z-table: 59.87% of students score less than 84 on this exam

### 4. Note: Use a normal distribution to approximate binomial probabilities

As part A mentioned, the binomial model has a unique set of formulas for individual and cumulative probabilities. But if the number of fixed trials, n, get too large like the below example, it is time consuming to calculate.

Researchers found that you can use normal distribution to get approximate answers to binomial probability problems when n is large.
