## Part A - Probability basics in terms of discrete random variables (continued)

There are many different distributions for discrete random variables. Each type of model has its own name, its own formulas for pmf and cdf, and its own formulas for the expected value, variance. 

+ Discrete uniform distribution (Note: ***Not all uniform distributions are discrete, some are continuous.*** Continuous uniform distribution can take continuous random variables with equal probability)

+ Binomial distribution

+ Poisson distribution

### 1. Discrete uniform distribution <a class="anchor" id="Discrete uniform distribution"></a>

A random variable X has a discrete uniform distribution if: possible values of X are consecutive integers from a to b; and possible value of X has an equal probability.

Example: If you stand on a street corner and give 100 dollar to any lucky person, then probability to get 100 dollar is equal: 1/total number passersby. However, if you favored women than men, they would have a higher chance of being given 100 dollar and that would not be described as uniform probability

**a. The pmf of the discrete uniform - Find probability for uniform**

The graph of the pmf of a uniform random variable is flat because each possible values of X has equal probability

***Example 1***: Roll a single die => a = 1; b = 6 => b - a + 1 = 6 possible values X = {1,2,3,4,5,6}: are consecutive integers => fits a discrete uniform probability model. Because each possible value of X has equal probability, pmf of X = 1/(6-1+1) = 0.17

Note: sum of 2 dice rolled does not have a uniform distribution although sum of 2 dice are consecutive but each possible value of X does not have equal probability.

***Example 2:*** In commercial lotteries like Powerball, it is a regulatory requirement that each outcome is equally likely. There are 45 possible Powerball numbers {1,2,3...,45}. So, when X is the Powerball drawn, P(X=x) = 1/45 if x = {1,2,3,..,45}. 

***If this model for the drawing of Powerball numbers is correct, we should expect that: over a large number of draws, the relative frequencies of the 45 possible numbers are all approximately equal to P(X = x) = 1/45 = 0.0222 [Read Law of large number](https://lytranp.github.io/notes/prob6). Actually, the following graph shows the relative frequencies observed in the 853 draws from May 1996 to September 2012***

**b. The cdf of the discrete uniform - Find probability for uniform distribution**

![](/sources/prob5-11.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

Example: Roll a single dice => a = 1; b = 6. So, cumulative distribution function F(2) = (2-1+1) / (6-1+1) = 1/3. Verify: P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

**c. The expected value, variance of the discrete uniform**

Expected value E(X) = $\frac{b + a}{2}$

Variance = $\frac{(b - a + 2)(b-a)}{12}$

### 2. Binomial distribution <a class="anchor" id="Binomial distribution"></a>

Suppose John guess 10 true-false questions in final exam. He counts the number of correct answers.

To have a binomial distribution, a random variable X must meet the following conditions

+ Have a fixed number of trials (In this example, n = 10)

+ You can classify outcome of each trial into 2 groups: success or failure (Correct or Wrong)

+ P(success) is the same for each trial (because you guess in same way each time => p = 1/2)

+ The trials are independent (the outcome of one guess does not affect the outcome of subsequent guess)

=> Guessing experiment meets 4 above conditions, random variable X which counts the number of success that occur in 10 trials, has a binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 0.6. This means that for every true-false question John answers, his probability of success (p = 0.6) and his probability of failure (q = 0.4) remain the same.

The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution.

**Note**: If experiment has the same characteristics as above but number of trials n = 1, it is called a Bernoulli Trial.

**a. The pmf of binomial distribution - Find probability for binomial**

The general formula of p.m.f for binomial distribution

Note: n (number of independent trials) and p (the probability of success) with different values creates different shapes. For example, for small p and small n, the binomial distribution is skewed right.

![](/sources/prob5-16b.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

***Example***: Flip a coin 3 times. P(exactly 2 heads) ? 

$\binom{n}{x}$ means the number of ways to get x successes from n trials.

$\binom{n}{x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$

Because X is the number of heads and in this case, you want the P(X = 2)

We have: n = 3; X = 2; p = 1/2 and $\binom{3}{2} = 3$. 

Plug into the formula: $3 * (\frac{1}{2})^{2} * (1-\frac{1}{2})^\frac{3}{2} = 0.375$

**b. The cdf of binomial distribution - Find probability using binomial distribution table**

If you have to solve problems with more than 2 values of X, e.g, P(X < 6) when n = 10 and p = 1/2. It means that we have to solve pmf for each X = 1,2,3,4,5,6, then sum up all. This takes a long time and many calculations. So, experts placed the cdf for the binomial into table form where the probabilities are summed up in each case. 

![](/sources/prob5-15.png){:height="60%" width="60%"}

***Example 1***: Using this table for the above: n = 3; X = 2; p = 0.5 => P(exactly 2 heads) = 0.375

***Example 2***: Peter shoots exactly 60% of his attempts. If he has 6 attempts, P(make exactly 4) ? 

=> n = 6; p = 0.6; X = 4 

=> P(make exactly 4) = 0.311

**c. The expected value, variance of the binomial**

**Expected value**: From general formula of Expected value for discrete random variable, P(x) is replaced by P(X) using pmf of the binomial.

### 3. Poisson distribution <a class="anchor" id="Poisson distribution"></a>

Poisson distribution of a discrete random variable gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, if these events happent at a known average rate and each tim is independent. X = the number of occurences in the interval of interest. X takes on values x = 0,1,2,3...

As we change the rate parameter lambda, we change the probability of a number of events occurring in an interval time.
