### 1. Sample space

The process is random because you conduct an experiment and do not know how the results will come out. Before you can figure out the probability of the result, you list all the possibile outcome: called **Sample Space**

P(X) = {Number of ways X occur} / {Total of possible outcomes}

- Finite samples spaces: you can write and count all elements in a set. E.g: roll a single die

- Countably infinite sample spaces: you can show progression of the values but they will go on into infinity. E.g: the number of phone calls that comes in to a restaurant in a week. Infinity because you can not be sure the maximum number of calls coming in.

- Uncountably infinite sample spaces: possible outcomes are too numerous to write down, so you have to include an interval to describe them. E.g Interval [1,2] is the set of all real numbers between 1 and 2. 

### 2. Intersection of events (The multiplication rule)

>$
P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) * P(B)
$

If A and B are independent, P(A $\vert$ B) = P(A). So P(A $\cap$ B) = P(A)*P(B)

If A and B are not independent, P(A $\vert$ B) != P(A). So, P(A $\cap$ B) = P(A $\vert$ B) * P(B)

***Example 1***: A class has 60% women. Out of women, 40% are married. What is the chance that a person is selected randomly is a woman and married

P(W $\cap$ Married ) = P(Married $\vert$ Women) * P(Women) = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24: 24% are women and married. 

***Example 2***: Roll 2 dices in sequence

- X: outcome of 1st dice

- Y: outcome of 2nd dice

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 2 OR X = 2 & Y = 1) = ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$) + ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$)

### 3. Union of events (The addition rule)

>$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$

+If A and B can not happen at the same time (*mutually exclusive*), they have no intersection: P(A $\cap$ B) = 0

+If A and B can happen at the same time, P(A $\cap$ B) != 0, so you need to subtract them to avoid double count

***Example 1***: Roll a single dice. P(X = 2 OR X = 5) ? (Probability at least one of events occur)

Because a dice can not happen = 2 and = 5 at the same time => P(X = 2 $\cap$ X = 5) = 0

P(X = 2 $\cup$ X = 5) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 5) - 0 = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$

***Example 2***: Roll a dice. P(Odd number OR < 5) ?

- P(Odd number) = 3/6

- P(< 5) = 4/6

- P(Odd number AND < 5) = 2/6

=> P(Odd number $\cup$ number < 5) = $\frac{3}{6}$ + $\frac{4}{6}$ - $\frac{2}{6}$

***Example 3***: Roll a dice

- Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

    + P(X = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$

    + P(X = 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$

P(X < 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{2}{6}$

P(X < 3) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ 

### 4. Independent vs Dependent events

**Independent events**: if an even has happened does not affect the probability of the other event happing. ***So, NO NEED to use conditional probability***. E.g: a dice rolls 2 times, then outcome of 1st rolling does not affect 2nd rolling

There are 2 ways to check for independence

If P(A$\vert$B) = P(A)

If P(A $\cap$ B) = P(A)*P(B)

***Example 1***: P(getting 2 consecutive tails) when tossing a coin 2 times ?

- P(tail) in 1st toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

- P(tail) in 2nd toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

=> P(consecutive tails) in 2 tosses = $\frac{1}{2}$ x $\frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{1}{4}$

*Verify answer*

- 1st toss: S = {H, T}

- 2nd toss: S = {H, T}

=> Combine into 4 possibilities for 2 times tossing S = {HH, HT, TH, TT} => There is the only 1 outcome {TT} out of 4 possible outcomes = $\frac{1}{4}$
  
***Example 2***: A pack contains 4 blue pencils, 2 red ones, and 3 black ones. If a pencil is drawn randomly and then **replaced**. P(2 blue & 1 black)

Total pencils = 9

- P(1 blue) = $\frac{4}{9}$

- P(1 black) = $\frac{3}{9}$ (because pencil is replaced, total pencils now remain 9)

=> P(2 blue & 1 black) = $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{3}{9}$

**Dependent events**

***Example 3***: Like example 2 but after drawing a pencil, it is **not replaced**

- P(1st blue) = $\frac{4}{9}$

- P(2nd blue) = $\frac{3}{8}$ (because 1st pencil is drawn and is not replaced, total pencils now is 8. Additionally, 1st blue one is drawn, total blue ones now is 3)

- P(1 black) = $\frac{3}{7}$ (because 2 pencils are drawn and are not replaced, total pencils now is 7. Additionally, not yet any black one is drawn, total black ones still remains 3)

=> P(2 blue & 1 black) = $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{3}{8}$ x $\frac{3}{7}$

### 5. Conditional probability 

**a. Solve conditional probabilities without a formula**

***Example 1a***: Roll a die. What is probability that roll is 5 if we knew that the die comes up odd?. Because we knew that the die is odd, we have 3 possibilities in total: 1, 3 or 5, and each are equally likely => P(die is 5 $\vert$ die is odd) = 1/3

**b. Solve conditional probabilities with a formula**

$
    P(A|B) = {\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}} = {\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}}
$

where

P(B|A) = P(A $\cap$ B) / P(A)

Please read more [Support metric](https://lytranp.github.io/notes/Association-Rule)

***Example 1b***: Go back to example 1a and using a formula to compute. 

P(die is 5|die is odd) = P(5 $\cap$ odd) / P(odd) = $\frac{1}{6}$ / $\frac{3}{6}$

***Example 2***: In a group of 100 people, 40 bought apple; 30 bought oranges and 20 purchased both apple and oranges. If choosing randomly a person who bought apple, what is the probability they also bought oranges. 

Step 1: P(A) = P(apple) = 40 / 100 = 0.4

Step 2: P(A $\cap$ B) = 20 / 100 = 0.2

Step 3: P(B $\mid$ A) = P(A $\cap$ B) / P(A) = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5

***Example 3***: What is P(Male $\mid$ own a pet)

![](/sources/prob1.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

P(Male $\cap$ Own a pet) = 0.41

P(Own a pet) = 0.86 

P(Male $\mid$ own a pet) = 0.41 / 0.86 = 47.7%

***Example 4***: A jar contains 6 balls: 3 black and 3 white. P(2nd black $\mid$ 1st one was black too)

P(1st black) = 3/6

P(2nd black) = 2/5 (because no replacement)

P(2nd black $\mid$ 1st one was black too) = ($\frac{3}{6}$ x $\frac{2}{5}$) / $\frac{3}{6}$
