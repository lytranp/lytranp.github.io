### 1. Sample space

Set of all outcomes that can have

P(X) = {Number of ways X occur} / {Total of possible outcomes}

***Example 1***: Roll a dice

- Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

    + P(X = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$

    + P(X = 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$

P(X < 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{2}{6}$

P(X < 3) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ 

***Example 2***: Roll 2 dices in sequence

- X: outcome of 1st dice

- Y: outcome of 2nd dice

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 2 OR X = 2 & Y = 1) = ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$) + ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$)

### 2. Intersection of events (The multiplication rule)

>$
P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) * P(B)
$

If A and B are independent, P(A $\vert$ B) = P(A). So P(A $\cap$ B) = P(A)*P(B)


If A and B are not independent, P(A $\vert$ B) != P(A). So, P(A $\cap$ B) = P(A $\vert$ B) * P(B)

***Example 1***: A class has 60% women. Out of women, 40% are married. What is the chance that a person is selected randomly is a woman and married

P(W $\cap$ Married ) = P(Married $\vert$ Women) * P(Women) = 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24: 24% are women and married. 

### 3. Union of events (The addition rule)

>$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$

+If A and B can not happen at the same time (*mutually exclusive*), they have no intersection: P(A $\cap$ B) = 0

+If A and B can happen at the same time, P(A $\cap$ B) != 0, so you need to subtract them to avoid double count

***Example 1***: Roll a single dice. P(X = 2 OR X = 5) ? (Probability at least one of events occur)

Because a dice can not happen = 2 and = 5 at the same time => P(X = 2 $\cap$ X = 5) = 0

P(X = 2 $\cup$ X = 5) = P(X = 2) + P(X = 5) - 0 = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$

***Example 2***: Roll a dice. P(Odd number OR < 5) ?

- P(Odd number) = 3/6

- P(< 5) = 4/6

- P(Odd number AND < 5) = 2/6

=> P(Odd number $\cup$ number < 5) = $\frac{3}{6}$ + $\frac{4}{6}$ - $\frac{2}{6}$


### 4. Independent vs Dependent events

**Independent events**: if an even has happened does not affect the probability of the other event happing. ***So, NO NEED to use conditional probability***. E.g: a dice rolls 2 times, then outcome of 1st rolling does not affect 2nd rolling

There are 2 ways to check for independence

If P(A$\vert$B) = P(A)

If P(A $\cap$ B) = P(A)*P(B)

***Example 1***: P(getting 2 consecutive tails) when tossing a coin 2 times ?

- P(tail) in 1st toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

- P(tail) in 2nd toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

=> P(consecutive tails) in 2 tosses = $\frac{1}{2}$ x $\frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{1}{4}$

*Verify answer*

- 1st toss: S = {H, T}

- 2nd toss: S = {H, T}

=> Combine into 4 possibilities for 2 times tossing S = {HH, HT, TH, TT} => There is the only 1 outcome {TT} out of 4 possible outcomes = $\frac{1}{4}$
  
***Example 2***: A pack contains 4 blue pencils, 2 red ones, and 3 black ones. If a pencil is drawn randomly and then **replaced**. P(2 blue & 1 black)

Total pencils = 9

- P(1 blue) = $\frac{4}{9}$

- P(1 black) = $\frac{3}{9}$ (because pencil is replaced, total pencils now remain 9)

=> P(2 blue & 1 black) = $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{3}{9}$

**Dependent events**

***Example 3***: Like example 2 but after drawing a pencil, it is **not replaced**

- P(1st blue) = $\frac{4}{9}$

- P(2nd blue) = $\frac{3}{8}$ (because 1st pencil is drawn and is not replaced, total pencils now is 8. Additionally, 1st blue one is drawn, total blue ones now is 3)

- P(1 black) = $\frac{3}{7}$ (because 2 pencils are drawn and are not replaced, total pencils now is 7. Additionally, not yet any black one is drawn, total black ones still remains 3)

=> P(2 blue & 1 black) = $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{3}{8}$ x $\frac{3}{7}$

### 5. Conditional probability 

**a. Solve conditional probabilities without a formula**

***Example 1a***: Roll a die. What is probability that roll is 5 if we knew that the die comes up odd?Because we knew that the die is odd, we have 3 possibilities in total: 1, 3 or 5, and each are equally likely => P(die is 5 $\vert$ die is odd) = 1/3

**b. Solve conditional probabilities with a formula**

$
    P(A|B) = {\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}} = {\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}}
$

where

P(B|A) = P(A $\cap$ B) / P(A)

Please read more [Support metric](https://lytranp.github.io/notes/Association-Rule)

***Example 1b***: Go back to example 1a and using a formula to compute. 

=> P(die is 5|die is odd) = P(5 $\cap$ odd) / P(odd) = $\frac{1}{6}$ / $\frac{3}{6}$

***Example 2***: In a group of 100 people, 40 bought apple; 30 bought oranges and 20 purchased both apple and oranges. If choosing randomly a person who bought apple, what is the probability they also bought oranges. 

Step 1: P(A) = P(apple) = 40 / 100 = 0.4

Step 2: P(A $\cap$ B) = 20 / 100 = 0.2

Step 3: P(B $\mid$ A) = P(A $\cap$ B) / P(A) = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5

***Example 3***: What is P(Male $\mid$ own a pet)

![](/sources/prob1.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

P(Male $\cap$ Own a pet) = 0.41

P(Own a pet) = 0.86 

P(Male $\mid$ own a pet) = 0.41 / 0.86 = 47.7%

***Example 4***: A jar contains 6 balls: 3 black and 3 white. P(2nd black $\mid$ 1st one was black too)

P(1st black) = 3/6

P(2nd black) = 2/5 (because no replacement)

P(2nd black $\mid$ 1st one was black too) = ($\frac{3}{6}$ x $\frac{2}{5}$) / $\frac{3}{6}$

### 6. Bayes Theorem (Reversing Conditional probability)

In conditional probability, we have to compute P(A $\vert$ B). Conversely, we need to know P(B $\vert$ A) if we know conditional probability P(A $\vert$ B). Bayes theorem now comes into the picture. 

Bayes theorem describes the probability of an event based on the prior knowledge of the conditions that might be related to the event. 

![](/sources/prob2.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

$
         P(B|A) = P(A|B) * \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
$

***Example 1***: You are planning a picnic today, but the morning is cloudy

- Given that 50% of all rainy days has cloudy, meaning Rainy -> Cloudy = 50% => P(Cloudy|Rainy) = 0.5

- Cloudy mornings are about 40% of days => P(Cloudy) = 0.4

- This is a dry month, only 3 out of 30 days tend to be rainy or 10% => P(Rainy) = 0.1

$
         P(Rainy|Cloudy) = P(Cloudy|Rainy) * \frac{P(Cloudy)}{P(Rainy)} = 0.125
$

Or 12.5% chance of rain. Not too bad, let's have a picnic

***Example 2 (Advanced)***

- 1.48 out of 1,000 people have breast cancer in the US at the time of survey.
=> P(cancer) = 1.48/1,000 = 0.00148

- Sensitivity of the test (TPR): 93%

- Specificity of the test (TNR): 99%

Please read more [Sensitivity & Specificity](https://lytranp.github.io/notes/ROC)


P(cancer|positive test)?

Because 0.148% chance that patient have cancer, (100% - 0.148%) chance that patient does not have cancer. 

![](/sources/prob3.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

P(cancer|positive test) = P(cancer AND positive test) / P(positive test)

Because a person can have cancer and test positive or he may not have cancer but still test positive => P(positive test) = P(cancer AND positive test) + P(no cancer AND positive test)

P(cancer AND positive test) = P(cancer) * P(positive test) = 0.00148 * 0.93

P(no cancer AND positive test) = P(no cancer) * P(positive test) = 0.99852 * 0.01

So, P(cancer|positive test) = P(cancer AND positive test) / P(cancer AND positive test) + P(no cancer AND positive test)
