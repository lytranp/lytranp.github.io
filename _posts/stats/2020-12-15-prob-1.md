### 1. Sample space

Set of all outcomes that can have

***Example 1***: Roll a dice

- Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

    + P(X = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$

    + P(X = 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$

=> P(X < 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{2}{6}$

   P(X < 3) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ 

***Example 2***: Roll 2 dices in sequence

- X: outcome of 1st dice

- Y: outcome of 2nd dice

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 2 OR X = 2 & Y = 1) = ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$) + ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$)

### 2. Independent vs Dependent events

Independent events: e.g a dice rolls 2 times, then outcome of 1st rolling does not affect 2nd rolling

***Example 1***: P(getting 2 consecutive tails) when tossing a coin 2 times ?

- P(tail) in 1st toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

- P(tail) in 2nd toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

=> P(consecutive tails) in 2 tosses = $\frac{1}{2}$ x $\frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{1}{4}$

*Verify answer*

- 1st toss: S = {H, T}

- 2nd toss: S = {H, T}

=> Combine into 4 possibilities for 2 times tossing S = {HH, HT, TH, TT} => There is the only 1 outcome {TT} out of 4 possible outcomes = $\frac{1}{4}$
  
***Example 2***: A pack contains 4 blue pencils, 2 red ones, and 3 black ones. If a pencil is drawn randomly and then **replaced**. P(2 blue & 1 black)

Total pencils = 9

- P(1 blue) = $\frac{4}{9}$

- P(1 black) = $\frac{3}{9}$ (because pencil is replaced, total pencils now remain 9)

=> P(2 blue & 1 black) = $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{3}{9}$

Dependent events

***Example 3***: Like example 2 but after drawing a pencil, it is **not replaced**

- P(1st blue) = $\frac{4}{9}$

- P(2nd blue) = $\frac{3}{8}$ (because 1st pencil is drawn and is not replaced, total pencils now is 8. Additionally, 1st blue one is drawn, total blue ones now is 3)

- P(1 black) = $\frac{3}{7}$ (because 2 pencils are drawn and are not replaced, total pencils now is 7. Additionally, not yet any black one is drawn, total black ones still remains 3)

=> P(2 blue & 1 black) = $\frac{4}{9}$ x $\frac{3}{8}$ x $\frac{3}{7}$

### 3. Conditional probability

P(A|B) = {\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}}
