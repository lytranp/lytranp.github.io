### Sample space

Set of all outcomes that can have

***Example 1***: Roll a dice

- Sample space = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

    + P(X = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$

    + P(X = 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$

=> P(X < 2) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{2}{6}$

   P(X < 3) = $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ + $\frac{1}{6}$ = $\frac{3}{6}$ 

***Example 2***: Roll 2 dices in sequence

- X: outcome of 1st dice

- Y: outcome of 2nd dice

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 1) = $\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$

=> P(X = 1 & Y = 2 OR X = 2 & Y = 1) = ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$) + ($\frac{1}{6}$ x $\frac{1}{6}$)

### Independent vs Dependent events

- Independent events: e.g a dice rolls 2 times, then outcome of 1st rolling does not affect 2nd rolling

Example 1: P(getting 2 consecutive tails) when tossing a coin 2 times ?

- P(tail) in 1st toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

- P(tail) in 2nd toss = $\frac{1}{2}$

=> P(consecutive tails) in 2 tosses = $\frac{1}{2}$ x $\frac{1}{2}$ = $\frac{1}{4}$
