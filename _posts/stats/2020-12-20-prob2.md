### 1. Understand probabilities

+Probabilities based on long-term percentages

Eg: chance of winning a lottery is 10%. This probability means that in the long term (over thousands of tickets), 10% of all lottery tickets purchased will win a price. It does not mean that if you buy 10 tickets, one of them will automatically win.

+Limitation of probability: Suppose you know that 60% of the people in the community are Democrats, 30% are Republicans. If picking randomly 1 person from community, what is the chance the person is a Democrat? The chance is 60% but you can not say that the person is surely a Democrat because the chance is over 50%. Percentages just tell that the person is more likely to be a Democrat.

### 2. Approaches

a. Classical approach

-Use Math and counting rules to calculate exact probabilities in many cases when you can count possible outcomes and figure their individual probabilities by using Math. 

Example

+ Roll 2 die: there are 6 possible outcomes for 1st die and have another 6 possible outcomes for 2nd die. So, there is: 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes for the pair.
