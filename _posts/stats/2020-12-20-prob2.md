### 1. Understand probabilities

- Probabilities based on long-term percentages

Eg: chance of winning a lottery is 10%. This probability means that in the long term (over thousands of tickets), 10% of all lottery tickets purchased will win a price. 

***It does not mean that if you buy 10 tickets, one of them will automatically win. ***
