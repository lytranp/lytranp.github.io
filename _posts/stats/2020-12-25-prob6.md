## Part A - Probability basics in terms of discrete random variables

### 1. Probability mass distribution (p.m.f)

Because of discrete random variables X, it takes integers only. 

Since f(x) is a function, it can be presented in a tabular form; or graphical form; or as a formula.

***Example 1:*** X = number of siblings of DSU students. So, X = {0,1,2,3...}. X is countably infinite number of possible values, X is a discrete random variable with a probability mass function. Find P(X = a specific value) = f(x).

***Example 2:*** Random variable X = sum of two dice. Because X takes integers, it is discrete.

***Example 3:***

We can draw a picture of the probability distribution of discrete random variable X by using relative frequency histogram. Depends on problems, probability distribution of discrete random variable has different shapes

### 2. Find probability - use p.m.f

***Example 2 - continued***

P(at least 7) = P(7 <= X <= 12) = P(X=7) + P(X=8) + P(X=9) + P(X=10) + P(X=11) + P(12) = 6/36 + 5/36 + 4/36 + 3/36 + 2/36 + 1/36

P(less than 7) = P(X=2) + ...+P(X=6)

P(at most 10) = P(2 <= X <= 10) = 1 - (P(X=11) + P(X=12))

***Example 3***

### 3. Find probability - use cumulative distribution function (cdf)

*Step 1*: Set up cdf

![](/sources/prob5-4.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

![](/sources/prob5-5.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

We can draw cumulative distribution function as the below

![](/sources/prob5-6.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

*Step 2*: After set up cdf, we can use it for calculating various probabilities. 

P(5 < X < 8) = take all the probability of X from 2 through X < 8 substract all the probability of X from 2 through X < 5 = 21/36 - 10/36

### 4. Find probability - Determine pmf given cdf

Given cdf F(x), you can find the probability mass function (pmf) for X

![](/sources/prob5-7.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

At X = 0, cdf jumps from 0 to 0.3 => P(X = 0) = 0.3. Next jump occurs when X = 1 and cdf jumps from 0.3 to 0.65

=> P(X = 1) = 0.65 - 0.3 = 0.35

Next jump occurs at X = 2 where cdf jumps from 0.65 to 0.8

=> P(X = 2) = 0.8 - 0.65 = 0.15

### 5. Mean (Expected Value), Variance of a Discrete Random Variable

**a. Mean (Expected value)**: 

+ Expected value is the long-term average value or mean after repeating an experiment theoretically infinite number of times. Example, if you only toss a fair coin 10 times, you might have 9 heads (90%). But if you toss a coins thousands of times, you will have around 50% heads and 50% tail because probability does not describe the short-term results of an experiment.
  
+  Karl Pearson once tossed a fair coin 24,000 times. He recorded the results of each toss and finally obtaining heads 12,012 times. In his experiment, Pearson illustrated the **Law of Large Numbers:** as the number of trials in a probability experiment increaes, the theoretical probability and the relative frequency get closer and closer together. Here, P(head) = Relative frequency(head) = 50%

+ Unlike the sample mean of a group of observations, which gives each observation equal weight, the mean of a discrete random variable weights each outcome x according to its probability p. So, **$\mu_x = \sum{x_i}{p_i}$**.

***Example 1:*** Discrete random variable X = number of refrigerators sold

![](/sources/prob5-8.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

E(X) = 0 * 0.3 + 1 * 0.35 + 2 * 0.15 + 3 * 0.1 + 4 * 0.05 + 5 * 0.03 + 6 * 0.02 = 1.42

=> Because more weight around 1 or 2, E(X) is approximately in around [1,2]. Over the long term, this salesperson should expect to sell 1.42 refrigerators per day on average, based on the data collected. In another word, over hundreds of days selling, you will come closer to the truth 1.42. That is why probability formulas are so helpful. 

***Example 2:*** Discrete random variable X = number of siblings of DSU students.

***Example 3:*** An individual plays a gambling game where it is possible to lose 1 dollar, break even, win 3 dollar, wo win 10 dollar each time she plays. The probability distribution for each outcome is provided by the following table

![](/sources/prob5-6b.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

The mean outcome for this game = -1 * 0.3 + 0 * 0.4 + 3 * 0.2 + 10 * 0.1 = 0.8

In the long run, the player can expect to win about 80 cents playing this game.

**b. Variance**

![](/sources/prob5-9.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

Shortcut formula: Variance = $E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2$

$[E(X)]^2 = 1.42^2$

$E(X^2) = 0^2 * 0.3 + 1^2 * 0.35 + 2^2 * 0.15 + 3^2 * 0.1 + 4^2 * 0.05 + 5^2 * 0.03 + 6^2 * 0.02 = 4.12$ 

=> Variance = 4.12 - 2.02 = 2.10
