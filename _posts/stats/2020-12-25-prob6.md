## Part A - Probability basics in terms of discrete random variables

### 1. Probability mass distribution (p.m.f)

Because of discrete random variables X, it takes integers only. 

Since f(x) is a function, it can be presented in a tabular form; or graphical form; or as a formula.

***Example 1:*** X = number of siblings of DSU students. So, X = {0,1,2,3...}. X is countably infinite number of possible values, X is a discrete random variable with a probability mass function. Find P(X = a specific value) = f(x).

***Example 2:*** Random variable X = sum of two dice. Because X takes integers, it is discrete.

***Example 3:***

We can draw a picture of the probability distribution of discrete random variable X by using relative frequency histogram. Depends on problems, probability distribution of discrete random variable has different shapes

### 2. Find probability - use p.m.f

***Example 2 - continued***

P(at least 7) = P(7 <= X <= 12) = P(X=7) + P(X=8) + P(X=9) + P(X=10) + P(X=11) + P(12) = 6/36 + 5/36 + 4/36 + 3/36 + 2/36 + 1/36

P(less than 7) = P(X=2) + ...+P(X=6)

P(at most 10) = P(2 <= X <= 10) = 1 - (P(X=11) + P(X=12))

***Example 3***

### 3. Find probability - use cumulative distribution function (cdf)

*Step 1*: Set up cdf

![](/sources/prob5-4.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

![](/sources/prob5-5.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

We can draw cumulative distribution function as the below

![](/sources/prob5-6.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

*Step 2*: After set up cdf, we can use it for calculating various probabilities. 

P(5 < X < 8) = take all the probability of X from 2 through X < 8 substract all the probability of X from 2 through X < 5 = 21/36 - 10/36

### 4. Find probability - Determine pmf given cdf

Given cdf F(x), you can find the probability mass function (pmf) for X

![](/sources/prob5-7.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

At X = 0, cdf jumps from 0 to 0.3 => P(X = 0) = 0.3. Next jump occurs when X = 1 and cdf jumps from 0.3 to 0.65

=> P(X = 1) = 0.65 - 0.3 = 0.35

Next jump occurs at X = 2 where cdf jumps from 0.65 to 0.8

=> P(X = 2) = 0.8 - 0.65 = 0.15

### 5. Mean (Expected Value), Variance of a Discrete Random Variable

**a. Mean (Expected value)**: Unlike the sample mean of a group of observations, which gives each observation equal weight, the mean of a random variable weights each outcome x according to its probability p. So, **$\mu_x = \sum{x_i}{p_i}$**. Mean is the long-term average value after repeating an experiment theoretically infinite number of times. 

Expected value formula of a discrete random variable

![](/sources/prob5-16.png){:height="15%" width="15%"}

To find expected value E(x): multiply the value of X by its probability. Repeat this step for all possible values of X. Then, sum the results.

**Example 1:** Discrete random variable X = number of refrigerators sold

![](/sources/prob5-8.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

E(X) = 0 * 0.3 + 1 * 0.35 + 2 * 0.15 + 3 * 0.1 + 4 * 0.05 + 5 * 0.03 + 6 * 0.02 = 1.42

=> Because more weight around 1 or 2, E(X) is approximately in around [1,2]. Over the long term, this salesperson should expect to sell 1.42 refrigerators per day on average, based on the data collected. In another word, over hundreds of days selling, you will come closer to the truth 1.42. That is why probability formulas are so helpful. 

**Example 2:** Discrete random variable X = number of siblings of DSU students.

**Example 3:** 

![](/sources/prob5-5b.png){:height="60%" width="60%"}

**b. Variance**

![](/sources/prob5-9.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

Shortcut formula: Variance = $E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2$

$[E(X)]^2 = 1.42^2$

$E(X^2) = 0^2 * 0.3 + 1^2 * 0.35 + 2^2 * 0.15 + 3^2 * 0.1 + 4^2 * 0.05 + 5^2 * 0.03 + 6^2 * 0.02 = 4.12$ 

=> Variance = 4.12 - 2.02 = 2.10

### 5. Basic probability models of discrete distribution

There are many types of probability models for discrete random variables. Each type of model has its own name, its own formulas for pmf and cdf, and its own formulas for the expected value, variance. 

+ Discrete uniform distribution

+ Binomial distribution

+ Poisson distribution

**a. Discrete uniform distribution**

A random variable X has a discrete uniform distribution if: possible values of X are consecutive integers from a to b; and possible value of X has an equal probability.

***The pmf of the discrete uniform - Find probability for uniform***

![](/sources/prob5-10.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

The graph of the pmf of a uniform random variable is flat because each possible values of X has equal probability

Suppose a = 0; b = 9 => b - a + 1 = 10 possible values of X, and each one gets probability 1/10 = 0.1

Example: Roll a single die. Possible values of X = {1,2,3,4,5,6}: are consecutive integers => fits a discrete uniform probability model. Because each possible value of X has equal probability, pmf of X = 1/(6-1+1) = 0.17

Note: sum of 2 dice rolled does not have a uniform distribution although sum of 2 dice are consecutive but each possible value of X does not have equal probability.

***The cdf of the discrete uniform***

![](/sources/prob5-11.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

Example: Roll a single dice => a = 1; b = 6. So, cumulative distribution function F(2) = (2-1+1) / (6-1+1) = 1/3. Verify: P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/3

***The expected value, variance of the discrete uniform***

Expected value E(X) = $\frac{b + a}{2}$

Variance = $\frac{(b - a + 2)(b-a)}{12}$

**b. Binomial distribution**

Suppose you flip a fair coin 10 times and count the number of heads.

To have a binomial distribution, a random variable X must meet the following conditions

+ Have a fixed number of trials (In this example, n = 10)

+ You can classify outcome of each trial into 2 groups: success or failure (Head or Tail)

+ P(success) is the same for each trial (because you flip coin the same way each time => p = 1/2)

+ The trials are independent (the outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of subsequent flips)

=> Coin-flipping experiment meets 4 above conditions, random variable X which counts the number of success that occur in 10 trials, has a binomial distribution with n = 10 and p = 1/2

***The pmf of binomial distribution - Find probability for binomial***

![](/sources/prob5-12.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

Example: Flip a coin 3 times. P(exactly 2 heads) ? 

$\binom{n}{x}$ means the number of ways to get x successes from n trials.

$\binom{n}{x} = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$

Because X is the number of heads and in this case, you want the P(X = 2)

We have: n = 3; X = 2; p = 1/2 and $\binom{3}{2} = 3$. 

Plug into the formula: $3 * (\frac{1}{2})^{2} * (1-\frac{1}{2})^\frac{3}{2} = 0.375$

***The cdf of binomial distribution - Binomial distribution table***

If you have to solve problems with more than 2 values of X, e.g, P(X < 6) when n = 10 and p = 1/2. It means that we have to solve pmf for each X = 1,2,3,4,5,6, then sum up all. This takes a long time and many calculations. So, experts placed the cdf for the binomial into table form where the probabilities are summed up in each case. 

![](/sources/prob5-15.png){:height="60%" width="60%"}

Example 1: Using this table for the above: n = 3; X = 2; p = 0.5 => P(exactly 2 heads) = 0.375

Example 2: Peter shoots exactly 60% of his attempts. If he has 6 attempts, P(make exactly 4) ? 

=> n = 6; p = 0.6; X = 4 

=> P(make exactly 4) = 0.311

***The expected value, variance of the binomial***

Expected value: From general formula of Expected value for discrete random variable, P(x) is replaced by P(X) using pmf of the binomial.
