The probability of normal distribution of [Part 9](https://lytranp.github.io/notes/prob9) shows that we had to make some restrictive assumptions (normality, known population mean, known population variance) in order to make statistical inferences. For example, if X (e.g. sale price) represents the population values and is normally distributed with mean (or expected value) E(Price) = 280 and SD(Price) = 50, we can find the probability to select randomly a house with sale price higher than 380 by converting to z-value.

Our goal is to draw conclusions using fewer assumptions. 

### 1. Sampling distribution

+ **Population parameter**: are population summary measures, represent the true values for the population and can not often be found exactly. E.g: population total T, population average $\mu$, and population proportion p.

+ In order to find probabilities for population total/average/proportion, we take a sample and find sample summary measures (e.g, total t, sample average $\bar{X}$, or sample proportion $\hat{p}$). These numbers are called **sample statistics**. We use them to estimate or predict numbers from population parameters.

+ When sample data is selected randomly from the population, statistics calculated from the sample can tell about corresponding population parameters. For example, a sample mean tends to be a good estimate of the population mean. Apart from sample statistics, we also need to quantify variability (variance) from one sample to another (our expectation is low variability). 

=> To do this, we take random samples over and over again, each time calculating a sample static (sample mean), then the mean of all these sample means would be equal to the population mean. Next, we display the histogram of these sample means: called the ***sampling distribution*** (sampling distribution of a statistic is the distribution of a statistic under repeated samples).

=> ***However, it is not actually necessary to take random samples over and over again. We can use results from probability theory to see what the sampling distributions is. So, all we need to do is take a single random sample, calculate a static, and we will know the theoretical sampling distribution of that statistic. For example, we will know what the statistic should if repeating samples, and how much the statistic should vary if repeating samples.***

### 2. Central limit theorem - known population mean E(Y) and known standard deviation SD(Y)

Suppose a population that has a mean E(Y) and SD(Y)

Take a single random sample of n data values: $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$,... $X_n$. This sample comes from that above population. After calculating, we have a sample mean $\bar{X}$. 

If we were to take a large number of random samples of n data values, calculate the mean for each sample, and display sample means on histogram, then the distribution of these sample means would be a normal distribution. This sampling distribution will have mean = population mean E(X) and standard deviation = $\frac{SD(Y)}{\sqrt{n}}$

The way we divide SD(Y) by $\sqrt{n}$ makes senses because when size n is larger, variability is smaller and vice versa. 

=> Theorem states that the sample sample (*of the single random sample*) has an approximate normal distribution with mean = population mean E(Y) and standard deviation = $\frac{SD(Y)}{\sqrt{n}}$

**Central limit theorem**

+ If the population is not normal, the sample size n needs large enough (> 30) => In this situation, we do not need the assumption of normal population.

+ If the population is normal, the sample size does not need large.

***Example***: In this example, we are not thinking about the specific sample mean we calculate from actual sample of 30 sale price $\bar{X} = 278$. Rather, we are imagining that we have a list of sample means (each sample has size = 30) from a population distribution with mean E(Y) = 280 and SD(Y) = 50. After calculating mean of each sample, we calculate mean of sample means $M_Y$. 

=> From central limit theorem, the sampling distribution of $M_Y$ is normal with mean = E(Y) = 280, and sd = $\frac{SD(Y)}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{50}{\sqrt{30}} = 9.129$

Because the sampling distribution is normal, we can convert it to standard normal distribution as [Part 9](https://lytranp.github.io/notes/prob9) using formula z-value

![](/sources/prob10-2.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

From standard normal with mean 0 and standard deviation 1, the 90th percentile of the sampling distribution $M_Y$ corresponds to the 90th percentile of a standard normal random variable is 1.282

![](/sources/prob10-3.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

This means that under repeated sampling, $M_Y$ has a distribution with 90% houses price < 291.793. ***This number of the sampling distribution $M_Y$ is much less spread out than the distribution of population:90% houses price < 344.100***

### 3. Central limit theorem - known population mean E(X) and unknown standard deviation SD(X)

One major drawback to the normal version of the central limit theorem is that to use it, we have to assume that we know the value of the population SD(Y). To solve this problem, we use Student's t-distribution in which replacing SD(Y) with repeated sample standard deviations, $S_Y$.

t-distributions are little more spread out than the normal distribution. This "extra variability" is controlled by degrees of freedom. Because we use an estimate of the population standard deviation, we are not sure about the population and if our sample standard deviation is a good estimate of the population standard deviation. So, it makes sense that the degrees of freedom is lower for smaller sample sizes.

***Example***: In this example, we are not thinking about the specific sample mean we calculate from actual sample of 30 sale price $\bar{X} = 278$. Rather, we are imagining that we have a list of sample means (each sample has size = 30) from a population distribution with mean E(X) = 280. Then, we calculate mean and standard deviation for each sample. So, we mean of sample means $M_Y$ and standard deviation of these repeated samples $S_Y$ .

=> t = $\frac{M_Y - E(Y)}{\frac{S_Y}{\sqrt{n}}}$

So far, we have focused on the sampling distribution of sample means $M_Y$, but what we would really like to do is infer what the observed sample mean, $m_Y$, tells us about the population mean E(Y)

### 4. Read more about sampling distribution (Optional)

Sampling distribution: To predict probability for population parameter, take all possible samples of the same size from population, finding sample statistics for each sample and making a probability distribution out of it. Each sample has their own sampling distributions with their own means and standard error (Standard error is the same as standard deviation but name changes when applied to a sample statistic)

*Example 1 (for sample total)*: A roller-coaster can hold a max of 30 passengers. How much weight the coaster can carry ? 

+ Select a random sample of 30 people, measure weight per person, then sum up the weight -> We get the sample total, t.

+ Repeat the process with another random sample of 30 people, record sample total, and then do it again and again. 

+ Then, put all the sample totals into a histogram. This histogram represents the sampling distribution of the sample total, t for total weights of passengers over all possible samples. 

*Example 2 (for sample average)*: Find average age ($\bar{X}$) of passengers on roller-coaster. 

+ Select a random sample of 30 people, measure weight per person, sum up the weight and divide by 30 -> We get the sample average $\bar{X}$

+ Repeat process with large number of samples (each sample has size 30)

+ Put all values of $\bar{X}$ into histogram, we have *sampling distribution of the sample mean*. 

*Example 3 (for sample proportion)*: Find the proportion of passengers on the roller-coaster who are women. 

+ Select a random sample of 30 people, take the total number of women in the sample and divide by 30. 

+ Repeat process over and over with large number of samples (each sample has size 30)

+ Put all values of $\hat{p}$ into histogram -> sampling distribution of sample proportion
