## Part B - Probability basics in terms of continuous random variables

### 1. Display of probability density function (p.d.f)

Suppose you weight 100 cakes and create a density histogram of weights, the histogram look something like this

![](/sources/prob6-1b.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

If we decrease the length of the class interval on that density histogram, it will look like this:

![](/sources/prob6-2b.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

If we push the class interval further and decrease the intervals even more, the intervals will eventually get so small that we could represent the probability distribution of X. This curve is describes **probability density function**.

### 2. Find probability - use p.d.f

+ For discrete random variable, we determine P(X = x) using p.m.f. But for continuous random variable, the probability at a particular value X is 0 because there is uncountably infinite possible values of X. That is, finding P(X = x) for a continuous random variable X does not work. Instead, we need to find the probability that X falls in some interval: P(a < X < b) using p.d.f of X, and F(x),the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f) of X. 

+ Remember that a density histogram is defined so that the area of each rectangle equals the relative frequency multiply the base of corresponding class. This suggests that if f(x) is p.d.f of x, P(a < x < b) = Area under the curve between (a,b) = integral of f(x) over that interval because in the limit, when delta(x) goes to zero, the sum becomes the integral.

+ Every continuous random variable X has a probability density function (p.d.f) f(x)

***Example 1:***

![](/sources/prob6-4b.png){:height="60%" width="60%"}

***Example 2:*** Find P(1 < X < 4)

![](/sources/prob8-4.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

![](/sources/prob8-5.png){:height="30%" width="30%"}

=> P(1 < X < 4) is 8.658%

### 3. Find probability - use cumulative distribution function (cdf)

Cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable X is defined in exactly the same way as the c.d.f of a discrete random variable: F(b) = P(X <= b)

![](/sources/prob8-7.png){:height="60%" width="60%"}

***Example:*** Suppose X has p.d.f $f(x) = 3x^2$ on [0, 1]. Find P(X < 1/2) ?

### 4. Mean and variance of continuous random variable

**a. Mean (sometimes called expected value)**: 

Mean $\mu_X$ or expected value of a continuous random variable X with probability density function f(x) is

Note: compare with the formula for a discrete random variable

![](/sources/prob8-9.png){:height="20%" width="20%"}

![](/sources/prob8-10.png){:height="70%" width="70%"}

**b. Variance**: 

Variance of a continuous random variable X is the weighted average of the squared deviations from the mean $\mu_X$, where the weights are given by the probability density function f(x) of X.
