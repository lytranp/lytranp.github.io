## Part B - Probability basics in terms of continuous random variables

There are many different distributions for continuous random variables. Each probability distribution has parameters (most distributions have between 1-3 parameters). These parameters establishes the shape of distribution and essential properties of the distribution, such as the central tendency and the variability.

+ You can not use p.m.f for X. Rather, you use probability density function (pdf) for X. 
  
+ For discrete random variable, we determine P(X = x) using p.m.f. But for continuous random variable, the probability at a particular value X is 0 because there is uncountably infinite possible values of X. That is, finding P(X = x) for a continuous random variable X does not work. Instead, we need to find the probability that X falls in some interval: P(a < X < b) using p.d.f of X, and F(x),the cumulative distribution function (c.d.f) of X
