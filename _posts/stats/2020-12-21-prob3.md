### 1. Picturing Probability

**a. Venn diagrams**

Use Venne diagrams when you are given probabilities of events by themselves (marginal) and join probabilities for A and B. In this situation, you can find probabilities for all other parts of the Venn diagram. E.g: P(neither A nor B); or P(exactly A)

*Limitation*: Venne diagrams do not work well if a problem gives you partial information like conditional probability; or when problem creates a sequence of events that happen in the a certain order. 

***Example***: Street has 2 traffic lights. P(red on 1st light) = 0.4; P(red on 1st light) = 0.3. P(red of 2 lights at the same time) = 0.1

*P(neither light is red) ?* = everything in S that is not included in A or B or both = $(A \cup B)^c$ = 1 - (0.3 + 0.1 + 0.2) = 0.4

*P(exactly one of light is red) ?* = either the first light is red and the second is not, or the second light is red and the first is not = Either part 1 or part 2 in venn diagram. Because two part are mutually exclusive, using the addition rule to find P(xactly one of light is red) = 0.3 + 0.2 = 0.5

**b. Tree diagrams**

Use when probability problems involve multiple stages or a sequence of events. Each possible outcome within a given stage is represented by another branch on the tree. 

*Limitation*: Tree diagram do not work well if problems give you intersection probabilities rather than conditional probabilities.

**Tree diagram for independent events**

***Example***: Flip a coin twice. This a 2-stage process: first 1st coin get either heads or tails; then 2nd coin get either heads or tails again. Sample space shows the combination of all possible outcomes of both stages.

Because 2 coins do not influence each other, outcomes are independent. So, to get the join the probability each, multiply the marginal probabilities (the probability of an individual outcome on each coin)

**Tree diagram for dependent events**

***Example 1***: In a group there are 4 females and 2 males. We need to select 2 people to be on the committee. Of course, we can not choose the same person twice. 

- At 1st stage: P(female) = 4 out of 6 and P(male) = 2 out of 6

- At 2nd stage *(called conditional probabilities because events depend on the 1st stage)*: because can not choose the same person twice, this is where the probabilities change. Assuming that you choose a female in 1st stage, we have 5 people left to choose: 3 females and 2 males: P(F $\vert$ F) = 3/5. Similarly, if you choose male at 1st stage, 5 people left to choose: 4 females and 1 male.  

![](/sources/prob3-5.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

From the above tree diagram, we can answer some questions

*P(choose exactly 1 Female)*: You have 2 ways to get exactly one female: choose Female first, then choose Male. Or choose Male first, then choose Female = P(F $\cap$ M) + P(M $\cap$ F) = 16/30

*P(at least 1 Female)*: means one or more Females, then you want P(choose exactly one Female) or P(choose exactly 2 Females) = P(F $\cap$ F) + P(F $\cap$ M) + P(M $\cap$ F) = 28/30 = 093 => This probability is high because you have twice as many females as males to choose from in the original group of six.

*P(both people have the same gender)* = P(F $\cap$ F) + P(M $\cap$ M) = 14/30

### 2. Law of Total Probability

**Formula for the Law of Total Probability**

![](/sources/prob3-7.png){:height="20%" width="20%"}

Using multiplication rule at each path and then, using law of total probability to add up all probabilities: P(S) = 0.35 + 0.18 + 0.1 = 0.63 => The chance a customer will be satisfied after choose randomly a restaurant in the town to eat is 63%.

### 3. Bayes Theorem

Given that a patient has the disease, the designer of blood test wants to know: P(positive $\vert$ disease) to check the accuracy of blood test. Using the Law of Total Probability, you will get the total probability of testing positive.

However, from the standpoint of doctor, he wants the ***posterior probability***: P(disease $\vert$ positive). This is a big question because testing positive is not always correct. So, the doctor wants to know if someone tests positive, what is the chance that he actually has the disease?. Using Bayes' Theorem can solve it.

**Formula for Bayes Theorem**

![](/sources/prob3-8.png){:height="20%" width="20%"}

where:

+ P(A) is particular event at stage one that has occurred given that you end up at event B after stage two. 

+ The numerator = P(A $\cap$ B)

+ The denominator = Law of total probabilities = total probabilities of all the pathways that lead to B

*Example 1*: A customer already ate at one of 3 restaurants and is satisfied. This means that event S occurred at stage 2, but you do not know what happened at stage 1. Given that customer is satisfied, P(customer ate at restaurant 2) ?

![](/sources/prob3-9.png){:height="15%" width="15%"}

From law of total probability, P(S) = P(S) = 0.35 + 0.18 + 0.1 = 0.63 

=> P(R2 $\vert$ S ) = 0.18 / 0.63 = 28.6%

***Example 2***

- 1.48 out of 1,000 people have breast cancer in the US at the time of survey.
=> P(cancer) = 1.48/1,000 = 0.00148

- Sensitivity of the test (TPR): 93%

- Specificity of the test (TNR): 99%

Please read more [Sensitivity & Specificity](https://lytranp.github.io/notes/ROC)

P(cancer|positive test)?

Because 0.148% chance that patient have cancer, (100% - 0.148%) chance that patient does not have cancer. 

![](/sources/prob3.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

P(cancer|positive test) = P(cancer AND positive test) / P(positive test)

Because a person can have cancer and test positive or he may not have cancer but still test positive => P(positive test) = P(cancer AND positive test) + P(no cancer AND positive test)

P(cancer AND positive test) = P(cancer) * P(positive test) = 0.00148 * 0.93

P(no cancer AND positive test) = P(no cancer) * P(positive test) = 0.99852 * 0.01

So, P(cancer|positive test) = P(cancer AND positive test) / P(cancer AND positive test) + P(no cancer AND positive test)
