### Static Methods

- Used without a calling object. You use the class name in place of a calling object. 

- Since it does not need a calling object, a static method cannot refer to an instance variable of the class, nor can it invoke a non-static method of the class. If we want to invoke a non-static method, we need to create a new object of class first and uses that object to invoke non-static method. 

- Java requires that a program's main method is static.

- In static method, you cannot access an instance variable. But you can access a static variable

Example: The class *Math* is provided automatically and requires no *import* statement. All of methods in the class *Math* are static, which means that we can use the class name *Math* in place of a calling object

### Wrapper Classes

- We have primitive types (e.g, int, double, char) and class types (e.g, the class String and user-defined classes).

- Every primitive type has a wrapper class, meaning that primitive types: long, float, double and char has wrapper classes: Long, Float, Double, Character, respectively. Wrapper classes allow you to have a class object that corresponds to a value of a primitive type. Wrapper classes also contain many useful predefined constants and methods.

a. *Boxing*

Boxing converts from a primitive type to a wrapper class

```java
    Integer numberOfStudents = new Integer(42); // n is names an object of class Integer that corresponds to int value 42. In fact, the object n has an instance variable is int value 42

    Double price = new Double(9.24); 

    Character grade = new Character('A');
```
Starting with version 5.0, Java will automatically do this boxing. So, the previous examples can be written in the simpler forms. This is an *automatic type cast*, but they are really just abbreviations for the longer versions that include the *new* operator.

```java
    Integer numberOfStudents = 42; 

    Double price = 9.24;

    Character grade = 'A';
```

b. *Unboxing*

Unboxing converts from a wrapper class to a primitive type
  
```java  
    Integer numberOfStudents = new Integer(42);

    int i = n.intValue(); // method intValue converts object of type Integer to an *int* value

    Double price = new Double(9.24);

    double d = price.doubleValue();

    Character grade = new Character('A');

    char c = grade.charValue();
```

Now, unboxing is also done automatically. So, they can be written in the shorter form:

```java
    Integer numberOfStudents = new Integer(42);
    
    int i = numberOfStudents; // in place of: int i = numberOfStudents.intValue();

    Double price = new Double(9.24);
    
    double d = price;

    Character grade = new Character('A');

    char C = grade;
```
c. *Combining automatic boxing and unboxing*

The previous examples only either automatic boxing or only automatic unboxing. But we can combine both of automatic boxing and unboxing in code. What really takes place is that Java automatically applies the appropriate accessor methods: intValue(), doubleValue(), or charValue().

```java
    Double price = 19.9;

    price = price + 5.12;
```

That code is equivalent to the following

```java
    Double price = new Double(19.9);

    price = new Double (price.doubleValue() + 5.12);
```

b. *Constants in wrapper classes*

Example, you can use wrapper class to find the largest and smallest values of any primitive number types

```java
    Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    Double.MIN_VALUE
```

MAX_VALUE AND MIN_VALUE are defined static named constants in each wrapper classes Integer, Long, Float, Double and Character. For example:

```JAVA
    public static final int MAX_VALUE = 2147483647;
```

c. *Static methods in wrapper classes*

```java
    Double.parseDouble("134.3"); // convert a string to corresponding type double

    Double.parseDouble("134.3    ".trim()); // method trim is in the class String
```

Like other classes, wrapper classes also has a static method called *toString* 

```java
    Integer.toString(35); // return the string value "35"
```

**Note**:

The wrapper classes Boolean, Byte, Character, Double, Float, Integer, Long, and Short have no default constructors. When creating a new object of one of these classes, you must provide an initializing value as an argument to the constructor.

```java
    Integer n = new Integer(); // INVALID

    Character mark = new Character('Z');
```

Wrapper classes do not have set methods, so you cannot change the value of existing objects of these classes.
