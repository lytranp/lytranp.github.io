### Static Methods

- Used without a calling object. You use the class name in place of a calling object. 

- Since it does not need a calling object, a static method cannot refer to an instance variable of the class, nor can it invoke a non-static method of the class. If we want to invoke a non-static method, we need to create a new object of class first and uses that object to invoke non-static method. 

- Java requires that a program's main method is static.

- In static method, you cannot access an instance variable. But you can access a static variable

Example: The class *Math* is provided automatically and requires no *import* statement. All of methods in the class *Math* are static, which means that we can use the class name *Math* in place of a calling object

### Wrapper Classes

- We have primitive types (e.g, int, double, char) and class types (e.g, the class String and user-defined classes).

- Every primitive type has a wrapper class. Wrapper classes allow you to have a class object that corresponds to a value of a primitive type. Wrapper classes also contain many useful predefined constants and methods

```java
    Integer n = new Integer(42); // n is names an object of class Integer that corresponds to int value 42
```
