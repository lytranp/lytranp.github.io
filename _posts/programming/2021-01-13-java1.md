### 1. Packages and Classes 

a. Libraries in Java called packages: a collection of classes. Java has a large number of standard packages that automatically come with Java. For example: 

- java.text

- java.io 

- java.util

- java.lang: contains classes that are fundamental to Java programming. These classes are so basic that the package is always imported automatically.

b. Start the names of classes with uppercase letters. Here are some examples of classes

- String class

- FristProgram class

- BufferedRead class

- JOptionPane class

- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

- System.out: *System* is class and *out* is an object
  
c. Start the names of variables, objects and methods with lowercase letters

### 2. Console input and output

Simple output to the screen and input from the keyboard: called **console I/0**

- Use *Scanner* class to read keyboard input 

- Use *Scanner* class to read file. Additionally, we have 2 classes needed:

    + *FileInputStream*: handles the connection between Java program and a file on disk

    + *FileNotFoundException*: used to catch error if file does not exist

There 3 different approaches to Formatting output

- Using method *printf*

- Using class *NumberFormat*

- Using class *DecimalFormat*
