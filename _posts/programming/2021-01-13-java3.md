### 1. Some terminologies of OOP

- An object of class: referred to as an *instance of the class* 

- Actions in a class: called *methods*

- Characters of object: called *instance variables*

- Each object might have different data, but all objects of a class have the same types of data and have the same methods.

- Methods of class have 2 kinds: return value and perform an action (void). Note: a method that returns a value can also perform some action besides returning a value. If we only want that action but do not need the returned value, we can invoke the method as if it were a void method and the returned value will simply be discarded. For example, 2 invocations of method *nextLine()*

### 2. Variables 

- There are 3 main variables 

    + Local variable: declared within a method definition. 

    + Instance variable: confined for characteristics of an object in a class

    + Static variable 

### 3. Parameters

*Parameters*: is a set in () of a method. Value is plugged in for parameters is called: *argument*

- *Parameters of a primitive type* such as int, double, char...: is a local variable. When the method is invoked, parameter is initialized to value user input. This mechanism is known as *call-by-value*.

- *Parameters of a class type*: more subtle and powerful than parameters of a primitive type. Methods can have parameters of a class type. That is ***this*** parameter. There is one common situation that **requires** the use of ***this*** parameter: to distinguish parameter of a primitive type and parameter of class type when they have the same name.

### 4. public and private Modifiers 

- Each instance variable is prefaced with modifier *public*: no restrictions on where the instance variable can be used.

- Modifier *private*: instance variable cannot be accessed by name outside of the class definition. Once labeling an instance variable as *private*, no way to change its value except by using one of methods belonging to the class. Normally, a method is private only if it is used solely as a helping method of of other methods. 

    + Accessor methods: allow you to obtain the data. 
  
    + Mutator methods: allow you to change the data in a class object. Note: Mutator methods can return a Boolean value

### 5. Special methods 

- Method *equals*: compare object to another object; return boolean. 
  
- Method *toString*: return a String value that represents the data in the calling object. It can output to the screen after invoking the method.
