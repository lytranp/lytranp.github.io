## 1. DISTINCT & COUNT

```
SELECT DISTINCT role 
FROM roles;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM roles; 
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(degree)
FROM people; 
```

## 2. Filter results

Come with **WHERE**

A few different comparison operators: 

; = 
; <>  ; <
; > 
; <= 
; >=

```
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE language = 'French'; 
```
