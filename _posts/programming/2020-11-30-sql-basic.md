### 1. DISTINCT & COUNT

```
SELECT DISTINCT role 
FROM roles;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM roles; 
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(degree)
FROM people; 
```

### 2. Filter results

Come with **WHERE**

A few different comparison operators: 

; = 
; <>  ; <
; > 
; <= 
; >=
; BETWEEN
; IN
; NULL 
; IS NULL

```sql
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE language = 'French'
and release_year < 2000; 
```

```sql
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
```

```sql
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year IN (1994, 2000)
AND views > 1000;
```
