### 1. DISTINCT & COUNT

```
SELECT DISTINCT role 
FROM roles;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM roles; 
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(degree)
FROM people; 
```

### 2. Filter results

Come with **WHERE**

A few different comparison operators: 
+ = 
+ <>  
+ <
+ ;> 
+ <= 
+ ;>=
+ BETWEEN
+ IN
+ NULL 
+ IS NULL
+ LIKE
+ NOT LIKE

```sql
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE language = 'French'
and release_year < 2000; 
```

```sql
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
```

```sql
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year IN (1994, 2000)
AND views > 1000;
```
*Note:*
% wildcard: 

+ LIKE 'Data%' -> 'DataMind'; 'DataCamp' match
+ LIKE 'DataC_mp' -> 'DataCamp' matches 

### 3. Aggregate functions

For whole table 
+ SUM
+ MIN
+ AVG
+ MAX
  
```sql
SELECT SUM(duration)
FROM films;
```

```sql
SELECT SUM(budget)
FROM films
WHERE title LIKE 'A%';
```

### 4. Name for field
In this situation, we have 2 columns named MAX. To avoid this, use 

```sql
SELECT MAX(budget) AS max_budget,
       MAX(duration) AS max_duration
FROM films;
```

```sql
SELECT (title), (duration / 60.0) AS duration_hours
FROM films;
```
```sql
SELECT MAX(release_year) - MIN(release_year) AS difference
FROM films;
```

### 4. ORDER BY

**ORDER BY** 1 single column 

```sql
SELECT title, gross 
FROM films
WHERE title LIKE 'M%'
ORDER BY title DESC;
```

**ORDER BY** multiple columns: sort the first column, then sort by the next, then the next and so on

```sql
SELECT birthdate, name
FROM people
ORDER BY birthdate, name;
```

### 5. GROUP BY

```sql
SELECT release_year, MAX(budget)
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year;
```

*Get the release year, country, and highest budget spent making a film for each year, for each country. Sort your results by release year and country*.

```sql
SELECT release_year, country, MAX(budget)
FROM films 
GROUP BY release_year, country
ORDER BY release_year, country;
```

### 6. HAVING & GROUP BY
Filter based on the result of an aggregate function

```sql
SELECT release_year
FROM films
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;
```

### 7. Altogether
```sql
SELECT release_year, AVG(budget) AS avg_budget, AVG(gross) AS avg_gross
FROM films
WHERE release_year > 1990
GROUP BY release_year
HAVING AVG(budget) > 60000000
ORDER BY AVG(gross) DESC;
```
