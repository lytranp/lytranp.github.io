### 1. DISTINCT & COUNT

```
SELECT DISTINCT role 
FROM roles;
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM roles; 
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(degree)
FROM people; 
```

### 2. Filter results

Come with **WHERE**

A few different comparison operators: 
+ = 
+ <>  
+ <
+ ;> 
+ <= 
+ ;>=
+ BETWEEN
+ IN
+ NULL 
+ IS NULL
+ LIKE
+ NOT LIKE

```sql
SELECT *
FROM films
WHERE language = 'French'
and release_year < 2000; 
```

```sql
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE (release_year = 1994 OR release_year = 1995)
AND (certification = 'PG' OR certification = 'R');
```

```sql
SELECT title
FROM films
WHERE release_year IN (1994, 2000)
AND views > 1000;
```
*Note:*

% wildcard: 

+ LIKE 'Data%' -> 'DataMind'; 'DataCamp' match
+ LIKE 'DataC_mp' -> 'DataCamp' matches
