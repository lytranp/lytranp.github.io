### Encapsulation and abstraction 

- Abstraction and encapsulation: deal with the same general principle: if a class is well designed, a programmer who uses a class need not know all details of implementation of class, only need simple description of how to use it. 

- API (application programming interface): is a description of how to use the class. Using encapsulation techniques, user only need to read API and not need to look at the details of the code.

### Overloading

- 2 or more different classes can have methods with the same name. Similarly, there are 2 or more methods in the same class can have the same method name. For example, many classes have a method named *toString*. 

- Rules for overloading: same name BUT different numbers of parameters or types of parameters

### Constructor

- Is a special variety of method

- Must have the same name as the class

- If you add no constructor to class, Java automatically provides constructor. It is preferable to define your own constructors so that you can have the constructor initialize instance variables, or do whatever constructors other initialization actions you want. 

Date d = new Date(); // 1st occurrence of Date is a class name and 2nd occurrence of Date is name of a constructor. 

- If your class contains >= 1 constructor, Java does not automatically generate any constructor. Most of classes you define should include a definition of a no-argument constructor.

- A constructor is called when you create a new object. To change the value of instance variable, you use mutator method. 

    Date birthday = new Date("December", 16, 1982);

    birthday.setDate("January", 10, 1912)

However, you also can change by doing the following; however what it works is discards the old object and allocates storage for a new object before setting new instance variables. So, for efficiency, it is preferable to use mutator method: setDate

birthday = new Date("January", 10, 1912);
