### Encapsulation and abstraction 

- Abstraction and encapsulation: deal with the same general principle: if a class is well designed, a programmer who uses a class need not know all details of implementation of class, only need simple description of how to use it. 

- API (application programming interface): is a description of how to use the class. Using encapsulation techniques, user only need to read API and not need to look at the details of the code.
