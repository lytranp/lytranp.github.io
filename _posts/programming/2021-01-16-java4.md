### Encapsulation and abstraction 

- Abstraction and encapsulation: deal with the same general principle: if a class is well designed, a programmer who uses a class need not know all details of implementation of class, only need simple description of how to use it. 

- API (application programming interface): is a description of how to use the class. Using encapsulation techniques, user only need to read API and not need to look at the details of the code.

### Overloading

- 2 or more different classes can have methods with the same name. Similarly, there are 2 or more methods in the same class can have the same method name. For example, many classes have a method named *toString*. 

- Rules for overloading: same name BUT different numbers of parameters or types of parameters

### Constructor

- Is a special variety of method

- Must have the same name as the class

- If you add no constructor to class, Java automatically provides constructor. It is preferable to define your own constructors so that you can have the constructor initialize instance variables, or do whatever constructors other initialization actions you want. 
  
```java
    Date d = new Date(); // 1st occurrence of Date is a class name and 2nd occurrence of Date is name of a constructor. 
```

- If your class contains >= 1 constructor, Java does not automatically generate any constructor. Most of classes you define should include a definition of a no-argument constructor. However, there are cases where a no-argument constructor makes little sense. For example, the class Person does not have a no-argument constructor for a reason: A person may have no date of death, but a person always has date of birth. Although no-argument constructor can initialize all instance variables, but there is no suitable value to initialize the instance variable *born* unless it is provided as an argument to the constructor. Since we are assuming that an object of class Person always has a birth date, which is not null, this is always true for every object of the class: called class invariant.

- A constructor is called when you create a new object. To change the value of instance variable, you use mutator method. 
  
```java
    Date birthday = new Date("December", 16, 1982);

    birthday.setDate("January", 10, 1912)
```

However, you also can change by doing the following; however what it works is discards the old object and allocates storage for a new object before setting new instance variables. So, for efficiency, it is preferable to use mutator method: setDate

```java
birthday = new Date("January", 10, 1912);
```
