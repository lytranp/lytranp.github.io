Managerial accounting is all about communicating to people inside the company. It's the information that is used on a detail basis, every single day inside the company. Managerial accounting, it's secret, it's detailed, and it's daily. 

Financial accounting of Walmart shows $495 billion in sales. But I am a Walmart manager and I need to drill down to know details that I can use to on a daily basis to run the business.


    - How many of those sales were in North America, in Mexico, in South America, in Europe, in Asia, in Africa ?

    - How many sales by store, and I don't want to just know it by store. I want to know sales by department. 
    
    - How much did we have last year in that same store, and what was our target for this year for that store? 

    - I want to identify my best-selling products and my worst-selling products: Are we selling mostly groceries? Are we selling mostly children's clothing? Men's clothing? Outdoor lawn care products?
    
    - How much are sold by seasons ? What sold in January? What sold during the holiday selling season? In fact, I want to go a little bit deeper, how about day of the week? What happened on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays? 
    
    By time of day, should we be open 24 hours, should we even open before noon? I want sales broken down by the demographics of the buyer. I can use this specific information to target specific buyers with specific deals, special coupons and so forth. 

### 1. Product cost

There are 3 kinds of costs

- Direct materials (wood): 1,000

- Direct labor (wages): 30 hours x 30 dollars / hour = 900

- Overhead costs to products and process (infrastructure, utilities, supervisors, maintenance, QA inspectors, property tax, insurance). In a traditional way, assign overhead costs in proportion to the number of direct labor hours: More worker hours = More overhead costs (because consume more electricity, more supervision, more maintenance...); fewer worker hours = fewer overhead costs. 

### 2. Break-even analysis

For example: Ticket sell for an event is 250; caterer charges 40; tickets were randomly picked and 1 ticket can win a car costs 18,000. How many people need to come in order to break even ? 1 person or 3,000 people come to event, car still costs 18,000. This is fixed cost. After a guest comes to an event, the event has 250, but need to deduct 40 for catering. So contribution margin per guest is: 250 - 40 = 210. 40 is variable cost: go up or down depending on the quantity of products / services delivered. For example, in a restaurant: the more people come to restaurant, the more money they have to spend on buying food. 

Therefore, break-even analysis = Fixed cost / contribution margin of guest = 18,000 / 210 = 86 guests. Break-even is built on separate costs.

### 3. Budgeting

Plan on paper, identify tough time in advance, shortfall in advance
