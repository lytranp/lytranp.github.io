The statement of cash flows is a report of the amount of cash collected and the amount of cash paid by a company during a period, a month, quarter, or year.

Statement of cash flows is to separate the cash flows into three categories: Operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.

- Operating activities: are the things that you do every single day in operation. When would you collect cash from operating activities? Walmart collects cash from its operating activities when it collects cash from selling items. A consulting company collects cash by providing consulting services to client and then collecting the cash from them. Those are cash inflows from operating activities. Examples of cash outflows from operating activities are cash paid for wages, for utilities, for taxes, for interest. 

- Investing activities: means investing in the productive capacity of the business. So, cash outflows from investing activities are buying new buildings, buying new land, buying new machines. 

- Financing activities: borrowing money and paying it back. I'm borrowing some money to buy assets. Those are cash inflows from financing activities. Cash outflows from financing activities: repaying those loans, paying dividends to owners.
