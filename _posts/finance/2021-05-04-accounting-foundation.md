## 1. Sources of financing

- Owner financing: entrepreneurs often put a lot of their own money into their businesses.

- Other equity investment: friends, family (so-called angel investors) put their money into business and they expect shares of stock in return. If their invesment is large enough, they are part owners of the business and can make decisions. If you succeed, their stock will grow in value. If you fail, they may lose their investment.

- Debt: you can also ask for loans from friends and family or from local bank. But people who lend you money are not part owner of business and can not make decisions. You have to pay them back on agree-upon terms. Otherwise, they are likely to have a legal claim on assets. 

## 2. Financial staff

- CFO: responsible for internal departments, oversee the management and strategy of the organization from financial perspective, responsible for the quality of the financial reporting. He or she should use that info to advise CEO on the financial issues facing the company.

- Treasurer: deals with the outside world: meet with analysts, communicate with investors, negotiate with bankers...This person reports to the CFO

- Controller: purely internal, responsible for general accounting, financial reporting, business analysis, asset management...Without consistent data from controller, CFO and treasurer can not do their jobs

## 3. Matching principle

- Match the costs with the associated sale to determine profits in a given period of time.

- Examples:

    + If company buy products in June to resell to customers over the next several months, it does not record the cost of all those products in June. Rather, it records the cost of each product when it is sold.

    + If company buy equipment in Jan and plans to use over the next three years, the cost of equipment is depreciated over the whole three years, with 1/3 equipment's cost appearing as an expense on the income statement each month (assume a simple-straight-line method of depreciation)

    + Company may pay tax bill once a quarter, but every month, accountant will tuck into the income statement a figure reflecting the taxes owed on that month's profits.

=> Cash-based accounting would not give an accurate picture of reality. For example, it might record a huge loss in the month when it paid for products, and correspondingly higher profit in the other months. So, everyone would not understand what caused the volatility. Accrual accounting matches costs to sales, so it gives you a more accurate picture of whether you are really making money on your sales.

## 4. Four flavors of accounting

- Bookkeeping: collect information and get things recorded. For example, Walmart has 10 billion customer visits per year. In order to operate, Walmart must have an organized bookkeeping system to keep track of what those customers bought, how much they paid, what items neeed to be ordered ... Google makes money by charging advertisers for customer views or customer clicks. So, to charge these advertisers, Google has to keep track of the number of clicks and what people clicked on.

- Financial accounting: report the summary results of a business or organization to people outside the organization. To convince strangers to invest, the owner has to report profitability and how much money the comany is making and lists what the business has and what the business owes.

- Managerial accounting: detailed and private information that is used internally to make daily decisions. Internal decisions that are made using managerial accounting data, for example, product cost, break-even analysis, budgets, performance evaluation measures, long-term capital budgeting, outsourcing decisions...

- Income tax accounting: Let's say I worked this year, but I'm not going to collect that 20,000 in cash until next year. Do I report the income this year or next year ?. For financial accounting income, accrual income: you do not follow the cash, you follow the effort that means that you report the income this year when you actually did the work. However, for taxable income, it is reported when you collect the cash. That is because good laws are objective and clear. If we measure subjective economic values, it is hard to tell who's right or wrong. Beside, I should pay tax when I have the cash to pay the tax.
