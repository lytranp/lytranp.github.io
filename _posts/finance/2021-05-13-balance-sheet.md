## 1. Assets

- Cash and Cash Equivalents (liquid assets): include money in the bank, money-markets accounts, publicly traded stocks and bonds that are owned by the company, can turn into cash in a day or less if you need to. 

- Accounts receivable (A/R): is the amount customers owe the company. A/R includes all the promises that haven't yet been collected. All or most these commitments will convert to cash that soon will belong to the company

- Inventory: Service companies often do not have much in the way of inventory, but nearly every other company: manufacturers, wholesales, retailers does. One part of inventory is value of products that are ready to be sold (finished-goods inventory). Second part often relevant to manufacturers is the value of products that are under construction (work-in-process inventory). Third part is raw materials that will be used to make products.

- Property, plant, equipment (PPE): includes buildings, machinery, trucks, computers, and every other physical asset a company owns. PPE figure is the total number of dollars it cost to buy all the facilities and equipment the company uses to operate the business. For example, you bought land at LA for 500,000 and the land could be worth 5 million today - but it will still be valued at 500,000 on the balance sheet. Relevant cost is the purchase price. Investors like to nose around in public companies' balance sheets in hopes of finding such undervalued assets

- Less: accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is a way of ensuring that the income statement accurately reflects the true cost of producing goods or delivering services. To calculate accumulated depreciation, accountants simply add up all the charges for depreciation they have taken since the day an asset was bought. In part 1, the way it depreciates can make from unprofitable to profitable. This also applies to the balance sheet. If company decides its truck can last 6 years rather than 3 years, it will record 50% smaller charge on its income statement. That means that less accumulated depreciation on the balance sheet, a higher figure for net PPE, and thus more assets. More assets translate into more owners' equity

- Acquisition: occurs when one company buys another. Assume you found a warehousing business called X that fits your needs perfectly. You agree to buy X for 5 million dollars. If you pay in cash, the asset labeled "cash" on balance sheet will decrease by 5 million dollars. That means other assets have to rise by 5 million dollars. And you have not done anything so far that changes liabilities or owner's equity. Since you bought a collection of physical assets, you will decide that X's buildings, sheving, computers are worth 2 million dollars, after deducting whatever liabilities. That does not mean you made a bad deal. You are buying a customer list, talented employees... So-called intangibles can be much more valuable than the tangible assets. Accountants call intangibles 3 million dollars goodwill and 2 million dollars of net physical assets.
