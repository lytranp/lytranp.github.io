## 1. Assets

- Cash and Cash Equivalents (liquid assets): include money in the bank, money-markets accounts, publicly traded stocks and bonds that are owned by the company, can turn into cash in a day or less if you need to. 

- Accounts receivable (A/R): is the amount customers owe the company. A/R includes all the promises that haven't yet been collected. All or most these commitments will convert to cash that soon will belong to the company

- Inventory: Service companies often do not have much in the way of inventory, but nearly every other company: manufacturers, wholesales, retailers does. One part of inventory is value of products that are ready to be sold (finished-goods inventory). Second part often relevant to manufacturers is the value of products that are under construction (work-in-process inventory). Third part is raw materials that will be used to make products.

- Property, plant, equipment (PPE): includes buildings, machinery, trucks, computers, and every other physical asset a company owns. PPE figure is the total number of dollars it cost to buy all the facilities and equipment the company uses to operate the business. For example, you bought land at LA for 500,000 and the land could be worth 5 million today - but it will still be valued at 500,000 on the balance sheet. Relevant cost is the purchase price. Investors like to nose around in public companies' balance sheets in hopes of finding such undervalued assets

- Less: accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is a way of ensuring that the income statement accurately reflects the true cost of producing goods or delivering services. To calculate accumulated depreciation, accountants simply add up all the charges for depreciation they have taken since the day an asset was bought. In part 1, the way it depreciates can make from unprofitable to profitable. This also applies to the balance sheet. If company decides its truck can last 6 years rather than 3 years, it will record 50% smaller charge on its income statement. That means that less accumulated depreciation on the balance sheet, a higher figure for net PPE, and thus more assets. More assets translate into more owners' equity

- Acquisition: occurs when one company buys another. Assume you found a warehousing business called X that fits your needs perfectly. You agree to buy X for 5 million dollars. If you pay in cash, the asset labeled "cash" on balance sheet will decrease by 5 million dollars. That means other assets have to rise by 5 million dollars. And you have not done anything so far that changes liabilities or owner's equity. Since you bought a collection of physical assets, you will decide that X's buildings, sheving, computers are worth 2 million dollars, after deducting whatever liabilities. That does not mean you made a bad deal. You are buying a customer list, talented employees... So-called intangibles can be much more valuable than the tangible assets. Accountants call intangibles 3 million dollars goodwill and 2 million dollars of net physical assets.

- Goodwill: In years past, goodwill was amortized (amortization is the same as depreciation, but it applies to intangible assets). Now, rule changed. FASB decided that if goodwill consists of the reputation, customer base and so on, then all those assets do not lose value over time. They actually may become more valuable overtime. In short, goodwill is more like land than it is like equipment. With the new rule, goodwill sits on the books and isn't amortized. Nothing at all is substracted from revenue, and profitability is higher. Some companies are accused of taking advantage of this rule. They buy companies without much in the way of physical assets and undervalue the assets. Doing so would increase the goodwill and lower the depreciation the company had to take each year. That, in turn would make profit higher and drive up the compan's share price. They had so much goodwill on its book and so little in the way of physical assets. If you took goodwill out of the balance sheet, the company's liabilities were actually higher than its assets. This is not a situation investors like to see.

- Accruals and prepaid assets: Assume you rent manufacturing space for the entire year for 60,000 dollars. It does not make sense to book the entire 60,000 in Jan as an expense on the income statement. You will have to spread expense over the year. Accrual is what has not yet been expensed.

## 2. Liabilities

- Account payable: When Walmarts buys inventory, the company promises its suppliers that they will pay in the future.

- Wage payable: Walmart, Home Depot and Target and almost every other other business in the world requires their employees to work for a few weeks and then pay them. How much have employees earned that the business have not paid them yet.

- Tax payable: They pay property taxes, they pay income taxes, they pay sales tax and of course, they do not pay these taxes in cash at the end of every day. When preparing a balance sheet, the company has to list out the taxes that they owe as of the balance sheet day. 

- Long-term debt: the business borrows that they are going to pay back far into the future, 5 years from now, 10 years from now... Long-term borrowing is an important way to get money to buy assets.

- Unearned revenue: When you book the flight ticket, you always have to pay before you fly. So, the airline has an obligation to give you a ride on an airplane. For example, United Airlines collected 3.9 billion from passengers but has not yet given them rides on airplane.

## 3. Equity

There are 2 general ways to get money to buy assets: if borrowing the money, the source of the financing is called liability. If the money is invested by the owners, the source of the financing is called owners' equity. There are 2 ways for owners to invest in a business. One is the amount the owners take out of personal savings: paid-in capiptal. Another way that owners invest in a business is through retained profits. When a business generate some income, the owner can choose what to do with those profits. For example, owner uses for personal reasons: we call these distributed profits is dividend that was removed from the business. Apart from taking out a bit of dividends, the owner uses these profits to put back into the business for expansion: buy more buildings, buy more inventory and equipment - we call that retained earnings. So, owner can invest directly (paid-in capital) or keep the profits in the business (retained earnings). Sum of these two things is equal to owner's equity.

## 4. Limitation of the balance sheet

- Most of the numbers in the balance sheet are not market values, they are costs. Let's say you bought a land 50 years ago for 5,000 dollars and the land now is worth 2 million dollars. The amount reported on the balance sheet is the original cost: 5,000 dollars from 50 years ago, not the current market value.

- Some very valuable economic assets are not reported at all in the balance sheet, especially intangible assets. For example, what are the most important economic assets of Apple?: Apple logo, Apple brand name, customer loyalty...Apple never had to pay to buy those economic assets, so it is zero on the Apple's balance sheet. Specifically, as of June 30, 2018, Apple's total recorded assets were $349 billion. At the same time, the actual market value, or market capitalization of the company, $1 trillion. In other words, the actual value of the company was roughly three times as much as its recorded accounting assets. Clearly, the balance sheet isn't capturing all of the value of Apple.
