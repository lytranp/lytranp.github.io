Different people use different kinds of financial ratios to assess a business

- Bankers and other lenders: examine ratios such as debt-to-equity to see if a company will be able to pay back a loan

- Company owners: gross margin to help them be aware of rising costs or inappropriate discounting

- Credit managers: they want to see quick ratio to know a customer's supply of ready cash compared with its current liabilities

- Potential and current shareholders: price-to-earnings or mutiple of annual EBITDA to decide whether a company is valued high or low in comparison with similar companies

There are 4 categories of ratios that owners, managers, and other stakeholders in a business typically use to analyze the company's performance: profitability, leverage, liquidity, and efficiency.

## 1. Usage of ratios

- Ratios offer points of comparison and thus tell you more than a number alone. For example, profit can be compared with sales, or with total assets, or with the amount you and other shareholders have invested in the company. 

- You can compare ratios with themselves over time. 

- You can compare ratios with what you projected

- You can compare ratios with industry averages

## 2. Profitability ratios

Profitability: measure a company's ability to generate sales and to control its expenses. None of these numbers is wholly objective. Sales are subject to rules about when the revenue can be recorded. Expenses are often a matter of estimation. So, profit reportd on the income statement reflect all those estimates and assumptions

### a. Gross profit margin

![](/sources/gross-margin.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

It tells how much you gain on every sales dollar you use - 22.2 cents; and how much you must pay out in direct costs (COGS or COS) - 77.8 cents

### b. Operating profit margin

![](/sources/operating-margin.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

Operating profit (EBIT) is gross profi minus operating expenses. So, the level of operating profit indicates how well you are running the entire business from an operational standpoint. A downward trend line shows that costs and expenses are rising faster than sales.

### c. Net profit margin

![](/sources/net-margin.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

Net margin tells a company how much out of every sales dollar it gets to keep after everything else has been paid for. But net margin is highly variable from one industry to another. It is low in most of kinds of retailing. In some kinds of manufacturing, it can be relatively high. The best point of comparison for net margin is a company's performance in previous time periods and its performance relative to similar companies in the same industry.

### d. Return on assets

![](/sources/ROA.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

Every business puts assets to work: cash, facilities, equipment, inventory... All these assets show up on the balance sheet. ROA shows how effective the company is at using those assets to generate profit.

### e. Return on equity

![](/sources/ROE.png){:height="50%" width="50%"} 

It tells us what % of profit you make for every dollar of equity invested in the company. Depending on interest rates, an investor can probably earn 3% or 4% on a treasury bond, which is essentially a risk-free investment. ROE does not specify how much cash an investor will get out of a company, since that depends on the company's decision about dividend payments and on how much the stock price appreciates until he sells. But it's a good indication of whether the company is able to generate a return.

## 3. Leverage ratios

Shows how a business is using debt. In the financial world, the word for debt is leverage. Leverage is defined in 2 ways in business: operating leverage and financial leverage. 

- Operating leverage: ratio between fixed costs and variable costs. Increasing operating leverage means adding to fixed costs to reduce variable costs. For example, a retailer occupies a bigger store means that increasing their fixed costs. But they hope to reduce variable costs because new asset is more efficient than the old.

- Financial leverage: means how a company's asset is financed by debt. 

Leverage of either kind help company make more money, but increases risk. For example, the airline industry: high operating leverage (all airplanes are high cost), and high financial leverage (since most of the planes are financed through debt). If revenue drops for any reason, these companies are not easily able to cut those fixed costs.

### a. Debt to equity

![](/sources/debt-to-equity.png){:height="50%" width="50%"} 

Both of these numbers come from the balance sheet: tells how much debt the company has for every dollar of shareholder's equity. Many companies have debt-to-equity > 1, meaning that they have more debt than equity. If the ratio is high, raising more cash through borrowing from bank could be difficult. So, expansion could require more equity investment.

### b. Interest coverage

![](/sources/interest-coverage.png){:height="50%" width="50%"} 

The ratio shows how easy it will be for the company to pay its interest. A high ratio is a sign that the company can afford to take on more debt or at least that it can make the payments. 

Too high debt-to-equity and too low for interest coverage are bad sign. Recently, rather than buying equipment such as an airplane, some companies lease equipment from an investor. The lease payments count as an expense on the income statement, but there is NO ASSET AND NO DEBT. So, companies already overleveraged are willing to pay a premium to lease equipment just to keep 2 ratios in the area that bankers and investors like to see. 

## 4. Liquidity ratios

Tell you about the business's ability to meet all financial obligations - not just debt but payroll, payments to vendors, taxes and so on. These ratios are particularly important to small businesses because small businesses are often in most danger of running out of cash.

### a. Current ratio

![](/sources/current-ratio.png){:height="40%" width="40%"} 

Current assets are those that can be converted into cash in less than a year, including accounts receivable, inventory, and cash. Current liabilities are those that will have to paid off in less than a year, including accounts payable, and short-term loans. In most industries, a current ration is too low when it is getting close to 1 because it is rarely able to cover the liabilities that will come due with the cash. Whatever their size, fast-growing companies need to pay attention to this ratio because cash flow is always a challenge of high growth.

### b. Quick ratio

![](/sources/quick-ratio.png){:height="50%" width="50%"} 

Shows how easy it would be for a company to pay off its short-term debt without waiting to sell off inventory or convert it into product. Any business that has a lot of cash tied up in inventory has to know that lenders and vendors will be looking at its quick ratio and expecting it > 1.

## 5. Efficiency ratios

Help manage the balance sheet assets and liabilities. For example, if you can reduce inventory or speed up collection of receivables, you will have a direct and immediate impact on the company's cash position.

### a. Inventory days (days in inventory)

![](/sources/dii.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

It measures the number of days inventory stays in the system. The numerator is average inventory, which is beginning inventory plus ending inventory (found on the balance sheet for each date) divided by 2. Some companies use just the ending inventory number. The denominator is cost of goods sold (COGS) per day, which is a measure of how much inventory is actually used in each day. In this example, inventory stayed in the system for 74.2 days.

So, inventory turns: how many times inventory turns over in a year is 360/DII = 360 / 74/2 = 4.85 times. In 2006, Target had inventory turns of 6.3 - a good number for a big retailer and Walmart's turns even better were 7.84. 

![](/sources/inventory-turn.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

### b. Days sales outstanding

![](/sources/DSO.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

It measures average time it takes to collect the cash from sales (how fast customers pay their bills). The numerator of this ratio is ending accounts receivable - taken from the balance sheet at the end of the period you are looking at. The denominator is revenue per day. In this example, it takes this company's customers an average of about 54.5 days to pay their bills. You would want to ask why is it taking so long: Are customers unhappy because of product defects or poor service? Are salespeople too lax in negotiating terms ? Are they not following up with customers when an invoice hits its term (at 30 days) ? Are invoices taking too long to reach the customer? If this ratio could get down, it would improve its cash position considerably.

### c. Days payable outstanding

![](/sources/dpo.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

The numerator is ending accounts payable. It shows the average number of days it takes a company to pay its own outstanding invoices. In another word, this company's suppliers are waiting a long time to get paid - about as long as the company is taking to collect its receivables. The higher DPO, the better a company's cash position, but the less happy its vendors are likely to be, especially if you depend on your vendors for frequent deliveries, good prices or access to the latest and greatest products.

### d. Property, plant, and equipment turnover

![](/sources/ppe.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

It tells how many dollars of sales the company gests for each dollar invested in property, plant, and equipment (PPE). It is a measure of how efficient you are at generating revenue from fixed assets such as buildings, vehicles, machinery. By itself, 3.9 dollars of sales for every dollar of PPE does not mean much, but it means a lot when compared with past performance and with competitor's performance. A company that generates a lower PPE turnover, other things being equal, is not using its assets as efficiently as a company with a higher one. So, we need to check the trend lines and the industry averages.

### e. Total asset turnover

![](/sources/asset-turnover.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

It compares revenue with total assets, not just fixed assets. Total assets includes cash, receivables, inventory, PPE, and other long-term assets. So, if we can cut average receivables, total asset turnover rises. 

## 6. Sustainable growth rate 

![](/sources/ROE2.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

It is an estimate of the amount of growth a company can sustain without requiring outside equity investment. This relationship assumes that you retain all your earning for growth. Let's say your net margin is 12 percent, your asset turnover is 1.50 and you have an equal amount of deb and equity in the business so that the ratio of total assets to equity is 2. In this case, sustainable growth percentage is: 12% x 1.5 x 2 = 36% (Assuming you do not pay shareholder dividends)

The equation shows that there are 3 moves to the hoop to increase sustainable growth percentage. One is to increase net profit margin: raising prices or delivering goods or services more efficiently (This can be tough if the marketplace you operate in is highly competitive). Second is to increase the asset turnover ratio: reducing average inventory, reducing days sales outstanding, reducing the purchase of PPE. Third, increase ability to grow without giving up equity by increasing the use of debt. 

If you can not improve net profit margin, manage the balance sheet to work on the other 2 ratios.
