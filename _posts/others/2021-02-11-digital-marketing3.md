### 1. Publish blog and video contents

- Time on site
  
- Scroll down: Reader scroll down a particular article to read more
  
- Number of views of videos

### 2. E-commerce website (Ikea)

- Get you to add to cart: this is 1st step forward purchasing
  
- Basket abandonment rate: if you add to cart without purchase -> problem: they lost potential sale
  
- Average order value: buy multiple orders, and want users to add more to cart. That is reason after you add to cart, it does not take you to directly to cart immediately so that they can measure metric: Average order value. When users buy on Ikea, they typically buy multiple products together. By not taking me directly to purchase page, they take chance that you are going to keep browsing the website and add more things to basket. Using this metric, Ikea potentially hurt Basket abandonment rate in favor of Average order value: that's is trade-off

### 3. KPIs for subscription-based products (The economists)

Subscription products have a unique set KPIs to track

- Conversion rate: number of people clicks subscription
	
- Upsell rate: if someone buys a more expensive package, it could be worth a lot more over the lifetime for business
	
- Churn: number of people who leave after subscribe 
  
=> The website found that: if giving the packages with more products are more likely to keep their subscription for longer => improve lifetime value 
	
### 4. Businesses rely on lead generation 

- Conversion rate: although get Hubspot free, they are upselling more sales-driven tools 
  
- Lead qualification rate: if you click get a demo, HubSpot will try to find out more information about your business (job title, your budget, # of employees etc.) => information is important to know whether you are right type for product. 
  
- Close rate: if you pass a qualified rate to the sale team but they do not close deal, they miss opportunity

### 5. Mobile apps

- Install rate (many factors affect install rate: icon app,â€¦)

- Activation rate: to see if they open after install app 

- Retention rate

### Engagement levels of different visitors to the website

- Blogs, articles, youtube: tend to stay longer. People who read blogs /articles have high chance to continue to click link to read  more pages and the chance they are converting into customers or subscribers very high because there is less visual competition, content is there and not many information trying to get their attention.
	
- Social media: tend to look at one page at only around 30s because social media has vastly types of information with more visual competition.

### How acquisition source affect the average lifetime customer value

- Come from organic search has higher than average lifetime value. Reason: people search for a product are proactive people, they can convert to a customer
  
- Come from Twitter: customer buy products because they utilize discount promoted on social media. But they do not become a loyal customer => less than average lifetime value
