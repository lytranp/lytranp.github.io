## Example

- Using wisdompets.com
  
	- Objectives for users on website that leads to revenue
  
		○ Fill out the contact form on contact page  => KPIs: how many people fill out

		○ Sign up newsletter  => KPIs: number of subscribers

Step 1: Create goals tracking on Google analytics:

- Goal 1: Contact us form
  
- Goal 2: Subscription
  
Step 2: Set up value for each goal on Google analytics

- Goal 1 - value: 25 dollar for every new contact
  
- Goal 2 - value: 10 dollar or more
  
Step 3: Check conversions on dashboards "Channels"

Goal completions: 10 ; Value per new contact: 25 dollars => Total goal value = 250 dollars

Goal conversion rate: Goal completions / Users = 10 / 500 = 0.02 : We have every 2 clients out of 100
