This part 2 will explain more in detailed about: Acquisition, Behavior and Audience

### 1. Channel

- Check acquisition by Channel, Medium, Source

- Our channel is primary dimension

    + Channel is search or social 
  
		+ Source: give us the website they came from
  
		+ Medium: type of campaign
  
=> We can compare all different campaigns on different search engines and different social sites to see where we get the best traffic. Are we investing the right channel, source? . Are we getting a good return on investment ?

Example
	
- Channel: is search, source is Google , and the medium is organic search
	
- Channel: is social, source is FB, and the medium paid ads on FB

### 2. Behavior

- Bounce rate is the best metric  to understand user's behavior 
  
- Bounce rate: means that client comes to website and immediately leave because either or page did not answer their question or they did not find answer. 
  
- If bounce rate on a certain page is low => these visitors who read this page contribute more to goal completion rate.

Example: Compare bounce rate across pages and compare with average bounce rate. The 2nd landing page has bounce rate higher average by 7.2%, indicating that clients come from this page not contribute to value goal

* Why do people bounce ? 
  - Content: does not match expectation
  
  - Design: does not work, not simple
  
  - Structure: related content not available
  
  - Call to action: not clear or presented poorly
  
  - Purpose of the page: not clear 
- 
=> need to provide content so that user can scan it quickly to find their answers

### 3. Audience

Example: 

Mobile sends the most visitors to the site, but conversion process from mobile device is not likely to be optimal
=> need to find out what is the problem, especially on Iphone (open Device to go deeper)
