### 1. Conversion rate

A. Compute conversion rate at each stage
	
- E.g: conversion rate at stage of visiting website  = 8,000 / 10,000
	
- E.g: conversion rate at stage of searches for product = 4,000 / 8,000 = 50%

B. Compute conversion rate from visiting website to purchase produce =  600 / 10,000 = 0.06

### 2. Event values

We can know how much a purchase is worth: Assume 100 dollar if purchase product, we can compute how much event is worth by work back through conversion rate

E.g: Value of stage D = 100 * 60% = 60 dollars 

E.g: since conversion rate from visiting website to purchase produce =  600 / 10,000 = 0.06 
=> Value of stage A = website visits = 100 * 0.06 = 6 dollar

### 3. Forecast values:
	
- There are 2 major components of forecast values:
  
    + Retention: % of people will come back and buy again. If 12% of people keep buying in the future, each person will add additional 12 dollar 
  
	+ Referral: means someone refers a friend. If 24% of people refer a friend, every time you get a purchase, then that is an additional 24 dollars in your pocket that you bank on in the future
	
=> After we adding, forecast value = 36 dollars 
	
	Because average order value = $100 
	
=> Lifetime value of a customer  = 100 + 36 = 136 dollars (Note: incorporate a discount rate because a dollar made today is more worth than tomorrow)
	
	Because conversion rate from website visits to purchase = 0.06
    
=> On average, every website visitor should worth = 136 * 0.06 = 8.16 instead of 6 dollars

### 4. Channel value

- Customers come through different channel that worth different amount to us

E.g: because conversion rate coming from brand is highest: 12% => a customer comes from brand is much more worth to us , assuming that we assign their value at 16.32 dollars which is double average
